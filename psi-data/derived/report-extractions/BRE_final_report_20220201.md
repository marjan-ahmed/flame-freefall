ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


# 1. Overview


The Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment is one of six independent experiments that make up the
Advanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME) project for which tests are conducted within
the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) on the International Space Station (ISS).


The experiment's Principal Investigator (PI) is Prof. James G. Quintiere of the Department of Fire
Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland. The experiment has two Co-Investigators (Co-Is),
namely Prof. Peter B. Sunderland, of the same U. Maryland department, and Dr. John L. de Ris (FM Global,
retired). The ISS research also benefitted greatly from the work of Parham Dehghani, a doctoral student
in the Fire Protection Engineering department.


Meanwhile, Dennis P. Stocker of the NASA Glenn Research Center is the Project Scientist (PS) for ACME
including BRE and the rest of the ACME investigations. In preparatory drop testing, etc., Dr. Fumiaki
Takahashi of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) served as the Deputy Project Scientist. For
ACME's spaceflight operations, the NASA science team includes Drs. Uday G. Hegde and Vedha Nayagam
who are also with CWRU.


The ISS operations were conducted in two separate rounds of testing during Increments 58-59 and 63-64.
More specifically, the first round of testing was conducted from Feb. to April 2019, while the second-
round testing occurred from Sept. 2020 to Jan. 2021. The first round of tests was limited to ethylene and
the 25-mm BRE burner, while the second round also included tests with methane and the 50-mm burner
(although not together).


# 2. Science Overview


# A. Background


This background is the Executive Summary from the experiment's Science Requirements Document
(SRD) of June 2013.


The goal of this research is to establish the burning conditions possible in a microgravity quiescent
environment. The approach is to do this using a burner to emulate (BRE, Burning Rate Emulator)
the burning for real condensed fuels, representative of common liquids and solids. This will be
done for quasi-steady burning conditions, albeit ideal in some cases, but the BRE will range over
a wide spectrum of real fuel properties. The key properties governing steady burning are (1) the
heat of gasification, (2) the surface re-radiation heat flux, and (3) the heat of combustion. Flame
radiation is also relevant in general and can be represented in terms of the laminar smoke point.
Its importance in microgravity flames needs study, but the first three properties are key.


Currently NASA assesses the flammability hazard of materials for use in space flight by an upward
flame spread "pass-fail" test (Test 1), and supplements with data from the Cone Calorimeter (Test


2). The latter test has the capability of measuring the three properties listed above. Hence, the


successful application of the BRE in microgravity can enhance the usefulness of Test 2.


Fundamental and ad hoc testing in microgravity at quiescent conditions has shown that quasi-
steady flames can be supported on candle-wicks, droplets, jets and, at very low ambient velocities,
small plastic samples and a burner flame. The established flames tend to have spherical or semi-

ellipsoidal shapes. Our preliminary work burning ethanol on planar wicks of 1 × 4 cm suggest
similar shapes in aircraft and drop tower tests. But this work showed instabilities in the drop
tower, and needs further exploration. Theoretical analysis based on microgravity jet flame length
correlations suggests that a 50 mm diameter planar material could support quasi-steady
combustion in microgravity for some liquid and plastic fuels. The analysis indicates that burning
depends on diameter, so several additional burner sizes will be needed to examine this effect.


Gas burners like the BRE have been used to successfully simulate burning of a wide range of fuels
in terms of their B numbers and configurations over a range of Grashof numbers. We have
successfully shown that for planar burning at different angle orientations that a burner can
emulate the flame standoff distribution, and even match the onset of unsteadiness to turbulent
flow. Theoretical analyses of such a problem are limited by the inability to accurately deal with
flame radiation, turbulence and variable properties. A burner simulation can be far superior as it
inherently contains these effects.


The construction of a 50 mm diameter prototype BRE burner with flame heat flux sensors has
enabled us to emulate both a methanol and heptane pool fire of the 50 mm diameter, reproducing
its color, flame character and shape, and heat of gasification for nearly the same surface
temperatures. We show that the BRE is capable of displaying the burning conditions in terms of
the fuel properties of heat of combustion, heat of gasification, and surface re-radiant heat flux
(with some likely effect of smoke point). A preliminary 3-D plot of steady burning gives a
flammability mapping in terms of these variables under conditions of gravity and atmospheric
variations. A mapping in microgravity can demonstrate the burning conditions for a wide range
of real materials in terms of these properties. In addition the effect of external radiation can
indirectly be assessed. The 50 mm burner has been redesigned, along with a 25 mm burner, to
reduce edge effects, provide improved heat flux sensors with temperatures, and cooling water
has been dropped from the both the burner and the heat flux sensors in microgravity
experiments.


The primary objective is to observe the burning behavior (including extinction) in long-duration
microgravity for methane/nitrogen and ethylene/nitrogen mixtures on a porous circular burner
of 25 and 50 mm diameter at various pressures, ambient oxygen, and CO2 (desired, to assess
extinguishment). Ignition will not be directly studied in microgravity studies, as we believe
normal-gravity experiments are sufficient for its study. Another objective is to obtain conditions
that can be related to microgravity behavior of condensed fuels that embrace the scope of real
liquid and solid fuels.


We think these results can establish fuel properties that directly relate to the fire hazard in
spacecraft, and these properties can be derived from NASA Test 2. The BRE is an efficient, safe,
and comprehensive technique for achieving these results.


This version of the Science Requirements Document has been refined since the Science Concept
Review (Aug 28, 2012). The panel wrote at that time that they "strongly encourage continued
development of the BRE experiment for implementation into the ACME and testing on the ISS."
We have tried to address most of their recommendations and suggestions. In addition, work has
progressed to include the development of two papers, and the commencement of drop facility
testing of the BRE. Those results have shown quasi-steady flames, and are very encouraging.

# B. Rationale for Microgravity


This is the 'Justification for Extended Duration Microgravity' section (2.5) of the experiment's SRD
from June 2013. Equations are not included here, but they can be found in the SRD.


Fire in a spacecraft microgravity environment is a likely event based on limited accident data, tests
to burn materials, and research that has explored simple burning scenarios. Indeed, NASA screens
the use of materials on spacecraft by its flammability Test 1.


Currently NASA Test 1 and Test 2 are incapable of directly analyzing material fire hazards in
spacecraft. There is no predictive methodology to extrapolate from these tests. However, NASA
Test 2, the Cone Calorimeter, is capable of determining heats of combustion and gasification, and
surface reradiation in burning. Steady (or quasi-steady) burning rate data from the BRE in flight
experiments will establish a flammability mapping in terms of these properties for microgravity.
In addition, using Eq. (2), the results can establish the necessary heat flux condition for other fuels
to burn in microgravity. The BRE is an efficient way to achieve quasi-steady burning. While
microgravity tests of condensed fuels have been performed and are planned, they are limited in
their ability to reveal sufficient information about the diverse condensed fuels that exist aboard
the ISS. Moreover the time to achieve quasi-steady burning rate of solid fuels can be of the order
of minutes as dictated by the time response of the solid. The BRE can be turned on and off quickly,
and its quasi-steady condition is only dependent on the gas phase phenomenon. While this time
is shorter, it can still be on the order of 10 seconds or more.


The proposed tests cannot be performed in parabolic aircraft owing to considerable g-jitter
disturbances. While limited testing is possible in drop facilities, the characteristic times for the
gas phase (approximately 20 s) and the burner surface temperature (approximately 40 s) preclude
consideration of quasi-steady conditions. Preliminary testing in the NASA 5.2 s drop facility
indicated the approach to quasi-steady burning, but longer tests are needed to confirm this
tendency. The longer duration testing in the ISS with the efficient operation of the BRE can
produce results only limited by the gas-phase response time.


# C. Science Objectives


The proposed objectives text presented here is the 'Experimental Objectives' section (2.2) of the
experiment's SRD from June 2013. ISS testing was not carried out to address the desired second
objective, where NASA effectively limited this experiment to the first and third objectives.


The BRE flight program seeks to establish the burning conditions in a quiescent microgravity
ambient in terms of material properties. The specific flight objectives are as follows.


1. Observe burning behavior in long-duration microgravity for CH4/N2 and C2H4/N2 mixtures on porous circular burners of 25 and 50 mm diameter. Consider O2/N2 ambients with various pressures and ambient O2 concentrations and pressures. NASA- considered atmosphere for human space missions will be examined: 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen: 10.2 psia, 26.5 %; and 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. Emphasize fuel conditions that can be related to a diverse range of condensed fuels.

2. Consider the conditions of Objective 1 for ambients of O2/CO2 (desired).

3. Consider the conditions of Objectives 1 - 2 for extinction limits.

# D. Science Success Criteria


This text is from the BRE portion of the 'Success Criteria' section of the ACME Integrated Science
Requirements Document (ISRD, ACME-SRD-001.B) from Sept. 2013, which is revision B of the
version prepared for the Requirements Definition Review (RDR). Achievement of superior success,
as defined below, was effectively ruled out by NASA because its plan didn't include the desired
tests.

# 3. Hardware Overview


# A. General Description


This section is copied from section 2.A of the April 2021 version of 'ACME Engineering
Implementation' which should be consulted for additional details. References to other sections
within the boxed text of this section refer to the ACME Engineering Implementation document.


This section provides a general description a general description of the ACME engineering from
the '3.0 Experimental' section of the following 2014 conference paper:
Dennis P. Stocker, Fumiaki Takahashi, J. Mark Hickman, and Andrew C. Suttles, "Gaseous
Non-Premixed Flame Research Planned for the International Space Station," Spring
Technical Meeting of the Central States Section of the Combustion Institute, Tulsa, OK, 16-
18 March 2014.


IMPORTANT: The 2104 paper from which this section was extracted proceeded completion of the
spaceflight hardware which was mostly launched in 2017. As a result, it does not accurately
describe the final engineering in some regards. Therefore updates, clarifications, additional
details, shortcomings, references, etc. have been included in boxed notes like this following the
original description. As a minor note, the sizes of figures were adjusted in this report, but none
were cropped.


As previously discussed, the ACME experiments will be conducted within the Combustion
Integrated Rack (CIR) using a chamber insert, depicted in Figure 2, which was designed to
accommodate gas delivery to a variety of exchangeable burners. Besides the chamber insert,
other ACME-unique hardware includes a high-definition color camera and an avionics package,
which is for data acquisition and control.

ACME's chamber insert, which is ~0.4 m in diameter, provides common mounting for a variety of
burners on the chamber axis (but only one at a time) and includes a retracting resistive igniter. As
depicted in Figure 3, there will initially be gas-jet burners (with inner diameters ranging from 0.4
to 3.2 mm), a small coflow burner (where the two concentric tubes have inner diameters of 2.1
and 25 mm), porous spherical burners (with diameters ranging from 6.35 to 12.7 mm), and two
flat porous burners for the BRE experiment (with inner diameters of 25 and 50 mm). Most burners
will be equipped with a surface thermocouple, and each BRE burner will have two heat flux
transducers. The internal pressure of the porous burners will be measured to allow monitoring
of the pressure differential across the outlet surface. The igniter will have a crew-exchangeable
tip and arm (to accommodate the various burners) and its stepper-motor drive will allow for
precise positioning.


Figure 3: ACME burner types, including from left to right, gas-jet burners, a co-flow burner,
porous spherical burners, and flat porous burners for the BRE experiment.


Ultimately, the spherical burners were limited to a single diameter of 6.35 mm, and the fabricated
gas-jet burners were limited to two sizes with nominal inner diameters of 1.3 and 2.1 mm.
However, only the larger gas-jet burner was used during the spaceflight tests. The burners are
addressed in detail in section 3.C.


Unfortunately, the spherical burners have not always yielded spherically symmetric flames,
presumably as a result of (1) greater burner flow through the joint between the porous sphere and
supply tube, and (2) heat loss to the support tube (encompassing the supply tube) causing local
flame quenching.


Two types of igniter tips have been used during ACME testing. Most tests have been conducted
using a loop igniter tip like those which had been successfully used in the droplet combustion
experiments which preceded ACME research in the CIR. However, some tests were conducted with
a coil igniter tip, where that included the second round testing for both the Burning Rate Emulator
(BRE) and Structure and Response of Spherical Diffusion Flames (s-Flame) experiments, with the
exception of the latter's first day testing. The CFI-G investigation will also use the coil igniter tip.
For more information about the igniter tips, see section 3.D.


The chamber insert includes three mass flow controllers (visible on the left of Fig. 2) for the
delivery of fuel, oxidizer or inert (e.g., helium or carbon dioxide), and nitrogen to the burner. The
maximum fuel flow is 2 slpm (on a nitrogen basis), whereas much higher flows, e.g., 10 slpm (on
a nitrogen basis), are possible for the oxidizer and nitrogen lines. The crew can exchange the mass
flow controllers to provide appropriate ranges that maximize the flow accuracy. The gas delivery
system enables on-orbit dilution of the fuel or oxidizer (but not both simultaneously), coflow,
inverse flames (e.g., oxidizer delivery to the center of a coflow burner), and premixed flames,

although the latter are not planned for any of the current ACME experiments. Gases can also be
delivered premixed to the space station where that is necessary in some circumstances, such as
the blending of different fuel gases. CIR's standard bottle sizes are 1, 2.25, and 3.8 liters but ACME
will sometimes use smaller bottles as a hazard control to limit the deficient reactant (e.g., fuel)
that can be released into the combustion chamber.

ACME's primary flame diagnostics are a suite of imaging systems including five video cameras and
two illumination systems, of which three cameras are part of the CIR facility and are already in
use on orbit. All but one of the cameras is mounted outside of the chamber. Collectively, the
imaging systems will enable color, CH*, and OH* imaging; pyrometry; measurement of the soot
volume fraction; and operational support. However, it is unlikely that all functions would be
exercised at any one time as will become apparent in the subsequent discussion.


Color imaging is provided by two cameras: a high-definition digital camera mounted outside of
the chamber and a standard analog camera mounted on the chamber insert (with a turning
mirror). Both cameras are part of the ACME hardware that is now in development. The analog
camera signal will be downlinked in near real time to support the experiment operations. Light-
emitting diodes within the chamber can be used to illuminate the igniter and burner to both
support the operations and provide reference images. The 12-bit digital camera records at up to
30 full frames (1360x1024) per second, and is equipped with a motorized lens with independent
control of the zoom, iris, and focus. The digital camera will be equipped with a filter assembly
with four options, where selection of a clear "filter" allows for color imaging. Color imaging can
also be carried out with a blue-green BG7 Schott glass filter, which balances the color planes to
avoid saturation in the red while maintaining sensitivity in the blue and green. The natural flame
color can be approximately reconstructed, but the primary purpose of the filter is pyrometry and
measurement of the soot volume fraction, again via the techniques of [23-24]. Alternately, CH*
imaging can be conducted with this camera because the filter assembly includes a 430-nm
bandpass filter with a 10-nm full width at half-maximum transmission (FWHM). A 450-nm
bandpass filter (again with a 10-nm FWHM) can be used with the CH* filter to effectively subtract
interfering broadband soot emission. However, the filter assembly rotates slowly so such
subtraction effectively requires a separate test with each filter and of course reproducible flame
conditions.

Pyrometry can alternately be accomplished with CIR's monochrome High-Bit Depth Multispectral
(HiBMs) camera, equipped with a Liquid-Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF), which allows for imaging at
multiple spectra, but requires a quasi-steady flame for measurement at each desired band. This
camera has a telecentric optical system and is recorded at 512x512 and 30 frames per second
(fps). Although it has a 1024x1024 pixel array, binning has been necessary because of signal loss
through the LCTF. Both soot pyrometry and Thin Filament Pyrometry (TFP) are possible, where
ACME is equipped with a crew-replaceable array of 5 silicon carbide (SiC) fibers. The fibers are
orthogonal to the flame axis and the array can be translated along the flame axis to the desired
position downstream of the burner, e.g., based on the downlink of the analog video. During set
up, the crew can manually orient the array so that it is orthogonal to either ACME's color digital
camera or the HiBMs camera with the LCTF. An alternate fiber array including a platinum wire
will be used for inflight characterization, which in combination with preflight calibration will
enable determination of the soot volume fraction [24].

CIR has a second HiBMs camera, without a filter, that will be used in combination with CIR's
illumination package for alternate measurements of the soot volume fraction. This will be
accomplished via an extinction technique previously employed in microgravity [3,6,26], where the
camera and the collimated light source (with its two fiber-coupled laser diodes) are positioned at
opposite windows. The images are recorded at 1024x1024 and 30 fps. Thus far, the primary
purpose of this combined system has been the measurement of the droplet diameter for
determination of the droplet burning rate.

CIR's Low-Light-Level Ultraviolet (LLL-UV) package is a monochrome camera with an intensifier
(for 280-700 nm) and a 310-nm bandpass filter (with a 10-nm FWHM) for OH* imaging. Again as
a result of the signal loss through the filter, binning is employed such that the OH* images are

The ACME chamber insert will also be equipped with non-imaging optical diagnostics including
both thermopile radiometers and Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). There is a crew-exchangeable
linear array of radiometers of which there are two versions supporting the initial set of

experiments. The array has a fixed position which is parallel to the chamber axis and centered
(along the chamber length) relative to the chamber windows and thus most of the other
instrumentation. One array is equipped with a single wide-view radiometer with two narrow-
view radiometers that are downstream and two more that are upstream, where all views are
orthogonal to the chamber axis, as depicted in Figure 4. The narrow-view radiometers are
intended to support studies of gas-jet flames, where ACME can accommodate shorter burners,
making the "lower" detectors useful. The other array, also seen in Fig. 4, provides for three wide-
view measurements of the flame, where one view is masked to nominally block radiant emission
from the burner. It was specifically designed for the BRE experiment but will be a resource
available to other ACME experiments. Given that the radiometer array can be exchanged by the
crew, alternate arrays could be developed.

An additional wide-view radiometer, that is fixed and not crew exchangeable, is positioned
downstream of the burner and flame at 30o from the chamber axis. This detector is primarily
intended to support the spherical flame experiments and will have a quicker response than the
more sensitive detectors that will used in the linear arrays. Like the radiometers on the two linear
arrays, it will have a spectral range of nominally 0.2-11 micron and its field of view will be
established by an appropriately selected aperture.

To detect the quenching of dim flames, the chamber insert will be equipped with a set of three
PMTs. Each PMT will have a wide-angle view, a sight line that is orthogonal to the chamber axis,
and will be centered (along the chamber length) relative to the chamber windows so that it is
aligned with most of the other instrumentation. The PMTs' spectral range will be 230-700 nm,


i.e., visible and near ultraviolet, but one will have a 310-nm bandpass filter and another will have


a 430-nm bandpass filter (where both are with a 10-nm FWHM). The pair of detectors will enable
measurement of OH* and CH* emission, respectively. The third PMT will be equipped with a
neutral density filter to prevent saturation. Like many other components, the PMT array can be
removed from the chamber insert by the crew.

The chamber insert is also equipped with six far-field thermocouples to measure the spread of
the thermal field in the spherical flame experiments. They are of limited utility for other
experiments because they are positioned upstream of the burner tip. Therefore, they will

generally not be installed by the crew to reduce the chance of accidental damage. There will be
two versions of a four-thermocouple rake to allow a choice of near and far measurements. Other
arrays could be designed to support future experiments, but they cannot extend downstream of
the burner tip without interfering with other (e.g., optical) measurements.

Experiment-unique hardware is also mounted on the chamber insert. For example, to
accommodate the E-FIELD Flames experiment, the insert is equipped with a high-voltage supply
and a crew-removable electrode mesh which can be set between +10 and -10 kV. The circular mesh
is orthogonal to the chamber axis and is positioned (during set up) at either ~35 or ~50 mm
downstream of the insulated burner. The ion current between the burner and electrode mesh will
be determined via measurement of the voltage drop across a known resistor and application of
Ohm's Law.

Additional supporting measurements will be made, where the chamber pressure is a simple
example. The ACME experiments will use the CIR's gas chromatograph for pre- and post-test
analysis of the chamber atmosphere, e.g., for oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
and fuel gases. Acceleration measurements will be provided by the Space Acceleration
Measurement System (SAMS) [27], which is the primary instrument for such measurements on
ISS and previously served that role for the space shuttle.

# B. Hardware Shortcomings


In terms of hardware, BRE's primary challenge was that the sensors for measuring the thermal
radiation, which had fixed amplification, often saturated. Although the measurements were not
documented as required to meet experiment success, they were considered sufficiently critical
that BRE was equipped with its own radiometer array, featuring three thermopile detectors.
Estimates had been made of the signal levels based on 5-second drop tests since the hot gases
tend to blanket the flame in the absence of buoyancy and thereby remain within the view of the
radiometers. As a result, the signal levels are strongly dependent on gravity. The estimates were
not part of the science requirements and may not have been sufficiently tracked in the hardware
development. Furthermore, the ISS tests lasted as long as 5 minutes, which is over four times the
envisioned BRE test duration and 60 times the duration of the drop tests. With the fixed
amplification of the radiometer signals, the data was frequently lost - other than the knowledge
that the limits were exceeded. Saturation of the radiometers was partially mitigated in the round
2 testing through use of ACME's standard array instead of the one developed specifically for BRE
which was used in the first round of testing.


The outlet surface of the 25-mm BRE burner (used in all but two of the BRE test days) became
scratched and worn, as seen in Fig. 5(a), through ISS stowage and/or handling. This degradation
presumably occurred following its removal after the first round of testing as seen in Fig 5(b). The
scratches are not evident in Fig. 5(c) taken when the 25-mm burner was removed at the end of
its use, but the outlet surface was clearly no longer uniformly black. These changes are important
because of their effect on the absorptivity of the burner's copper outlet plate. Note that Figs. 5(b)

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

As discussed in the preceding section, the ACME DataCam is unfortunately not as sensitive as had
been hoped to the dim microgravity flames. As a result, it was often used with a long exposure
time limiting the framing rate, or a high gain amplifying noise in the image.


On 3 Sept. 2020 (20247), the first day of BRE's second round, the gas flow didn't always transition
as to the desired flow rate as intended. The intended igniter arm was missing (but found before
the next test day) and use of an alternate arm led to the concerns about ignition success and the
decision to ignite at the same successful flow conditions and subsequently adjust the fuel flow
rate to the desired test value. The first attempt was successful, but the transition time was then
shortened to save fuel, but it was reduced to the degree that it unfortunately prevented the
intended flow transition. Unfortunately, this shortcoming wasn't discovered until during a review
of the data days later. As a result, the tests on that day were generally conducted at the same
fuel flow rate, which was meant to be a variable. Therefore, a make-up test day was conducted
on 28 Jan. 2021 (21028) to address the science loss.


More generally, ACME's Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) used to control the flow of fuel and
nitrogen have unfortunately not always performed adequately, where the flow rates have not
always been appropriately steady. Steps were made to mitigate such behavior, e.g., by zero-ing
the MFCs prior to each test, but they were not completely successful. Furthermore, when an MFC
is used at a small fraction of its maximum flow rate, the actual flow rate sometimes differs from
that desired.


During testing on 23 Dec. 2020 (20358), it was discovered that the lowest of the 14-micron silicon
carbide fibers on the Thin Filament Pyrometry (TFP) fiber array had broken. After some
discussion, testing continued that day. Given that the translating array had five ceramic fibers,
the loss of one was not a significant science loss. But it was a concern for crew safety. Recovery
plans were developed and enacted on January 18 to remove the broken fragments from the harp-
like array. Unfortunately, the next fiber was broken during the delicate operations where the
fibers are only spaced 5 mm apart. As a result, the last two BRE test days were conducted with
only three rather than five fibers in the TFP array. ACME does have alternate fiber arrays, but
there were months of testing remaining and the decision was made to continue testing with only
3 fibers.


Ignition was not always successful. As an extreme example, it was discovered on 1 April 2019
(19091) that the hot-wire igniter tip had failed on the preceding test day, preventing further flame
testing until it could be replaced. While such circumstances are uncommon for ACME operations,
BRE tests were sometimes conducted under conditions, e.g., for igniter activation and
deactivation, which led to momentary flashes without sustained ignition. Given that unplanned
crew time is required to replace failed igniter tips, the BRE ops team limited - to varying degrees


- the igniter voltage and the time that it was energized within the flame. The latter was known


from earlier research in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to degrade the hot-wire igniter tip
and hasten its demise. It is notable that the flashes of flame (across the burner surface)
sometimes continued briefly after the igniter was deactivated and retracted. In one case on the
first day of testing, there was excess fuel and a 'fireball' was ignited which promptly quenched.
Ignition also sometimes failed due to a software limitation where the fuelFlowIgnitionDeltaMs
parameter which specifies the relative timing of the fuel flow and igniter activation must be evenly
divisible by 100 (ms). This limitation wasn't initially understood and the igniter sometimes didn't
energize as a result.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

While it rarely occurred, BRE tests sometimes automatically aborted (due to the controlling
software script), where that is typically prior to gas flow and the activation of the igniter. As a
result, there is little lost other than the time associated with the failed test attempt. Such aborts
typically occur because of communication issues with an Image Processing and Storage Unit
(IPSU).


In addition to this section (3), shortcomings are discussed in Appendices B to E of this report and
the ACME Engineering Implementation document.


# 4. Preliminary Results


The burner has shown that quasi-steady burning is possible for real solids with a flat surface of 25 mm
diameter. Up to now most flammability studies in microgravity have focused on flame spread with a
wind for concurrent spread and at least a self-induced wind for opposed flow spread. We already
knew that this would be possible from normal-gravity research. The burning of liquids, as in a wick of
a candle flame and small droplets, has been shown to produce steady flames. However, many droplet
flames were found to extinguish owing to radiative cooling of the flame. We see this as well in the
extended ISS microgravity tests. However, this extinction was predominately seen for nominal
ambient conditions of 21% oxygen and 14.7 psia. At conditions of 27% oxygen, 10.2 psia and 34%
oxygen, 8.2 psia, the flames generally persisted for 3 minutes or more. These are all atmospheric
conditions that NASA is considering for future spacecraft.


# A. Changed Test Plans


While BRE's proposal included desired testing with carbon-dioxide-diluted atmospheres, NASA's
plan for the ISS investigation did not include desired testing. Therefore, the exclusion of that
testing was not a change in plans.


The most significant change was the use of ACME's standard radiometer array rather than the
BRE radiometer array in BRE's second round of testing. This change was made because the BRE
array was found to generally saturate during the ISS tests. The ACME array had a greater range
but nonetheless still often saturated during testing.


Significant changes were made to the ignition procedure in the early first-round testing, both
relative to the preceding ACME experiments and in the first few days of BRE testing. Compared
to the other ACME burners (neglecting the outer plenum of the coflow burner), the BRE burners
have a much greater internal volume. Therefore, the fuel flow was begun before the igniter was
energized, where that period ranged from a few seconds to roughly 1 minute. The duration was
typically about 15 and 30 seconds for the 25- and 50-mm BRE burners, respectively. In contrast,
the fuel flow has commonly been started when the igniter is energized in the other ACME
investigations.


Despite the duration of fuel flow prior to igniter activation, there was concern about
understanding the composition of the gas initially flowing from the burner. Therefore, on the
second BRE test day (20 Feb. 2019, i.e., 19051), a no-flame 'test' was run before each flame test
in which the burner was flushed with nitrogen at 0.15 slpm for 15 seconds. A shortcoming of this
measure was that the time between the nitrogen flushing and the start of the fuel flow was not


18




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


precisely controlled. Therefore, the software script used to run the BRE tests was subsequently
altered to allow specification of a 'pre-flow' with a specified wait time between the pre-flow and
the start of the gas flow for the flame. Although the script allowed for a pre-flow of nitrogen
and/or fuel, only nitrogen was used for the pre-flow during BRE's ISS testing. The revised script
was implemented on BRE's third test day (25 Feb. 2019, 19056) where a nitrogen flow rate of 0.15
slpm for 15 seconds continued to be used throughout the remainder of the first round.


A wait time of 2 minutes was used in the first two 19056 tests, while a 1-minute wait was used
for the remainder of testing on that day. During the remaining round-one test days, the wait
duration was consistently 50 seconds. With the script change, the basic non-imaging data file
captured the data during both the pre-flow and in the flame test, but it is important to understand
that data was not acquired throughout the wait duration. Therefore, one should pay close
attention to the time stamp when reviewing BRE data prior to the start of the fuel flow because
the listed time abruptly jumps.


Although the script wasn't significantly modified, there were changes to the ignition procedure in
the second round of BRE tests. It was concluded that the nitrogen pre-flow wasn't needed for the
first test of the day or the first test after the chamber was evacuated and refilled. The wait time
between the pre-flow and the start of the fuel flow was also increased to 5 minutes throughout
the second round, whereas it was 50 seconds in most of the first-round tests. This was done to
ensure that the atmosphere in the chamber was quiescent prior to the start of the fuel flow. Pre-
flow durations and flow rates were also somewhat different. In the tests on the first round-two
test day (20247), which featured the 50-mm burner, the pre-flow was at ~0.5 slpm for 5 or 10
seconds. On the two subsequent test days (20261 and 20279), the pre-flow was at 0.19 slpm for


3.2 seconds. For the remaining test days (20339, 20346, 20352, 20358, 21020, and 21028), the


pre-flow was instead 0.16 slpm for 5 seconds, where that includes the final test day which also
featured the 50-mm burner. As such, the pre-flow differed significantly between the two test
days with the larger BRE burner.


A few minor changes were made to the script after the addition of the pre-flow to flush the
burner's internal volume:
~2020-03-17 flow ramp hold was fixed so that the hold values were achieved exactly
~2020-12-18 ignition detection was disabled prior to igniter arm retraction so that the
retraction wasn't interrupted
The first change was implemented between the first and second rounds of testing, while the
second was made during the second round. The final version of the script will be included in the
upcoming ACME/BRE Experimental Procedure document.


While a minor factor, BRE made use of the coiled type of igniter tip in second-round testing as
compared to the standard loop-type igniter used in the first round. BRE ignition seemed to
require significant ignition energy and the coiled igniter design is believed to be more robust. The
coiled igniter tip was developed as an alternate after ignition challenges with the Coflow Laminar
Diffusion Flame (CLD Flame) experiment in late 2017. The development of the coiled igniter tips
continued even though it was later determined that the igniter had not been properly aligned
with the burner outlet in the early CLD Flame testing. The two igniter designs are discussed and
depicted in the ACME Engineering Implementation document.


In contrast to BRE's success criteria (discussed in section 2.D), which identified the importance of


19




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


measuring the flame temperature, BRE's first round testing seldom made use of Thin Filament
Pyrometry (TFP). In contrast, TFP data was acquired in a significant fraction of the second-round
testing. In this regard, TFP use was important because the BRE flames quickly became non-sooty
even with oxygen concentrations of up to 40% (by volume) so measurements couldn't be made
via soot pyrometry.


Tests were conducted as planned at atmospheres being considered for future spacecraft,
featuring elevated oxygen concentrations and reduced pressures (nominally maintaining the
oxygen partial pressure), but more of the testing was conducted at roughly atmospheric pressure
with elevated oxygen concentrations. The latter tests were carried out in a broader exploration
of material flammability in microgravity.

The CIR experiments are configured, but not conducted, by the ISS crew. Thus far, ACME's activity
has included the majority of the crew members, regardless of their nationalities. Most often the
astronauts and cosmonauts exchange gas bottles, mass flow controllers, and igniter tips. In the
latter case, the igniter tip exchange can occur after failure or proactively before failure when the
crew already has changes to make changes in the interior of the insert. While these activities may
seem mundane, the crew play a critical role in setting up the hardware for each experiment. As
an extreme example, there were crew activities on 8 separate days in Sept.-Oct. 2017 to configure
the CIR and ACME hardware for the first ACME experiment, namely the Coflow Laminar Diffusion
Flame (CLD Flame) experiment. In contrast, only two crew days were required to reconfigure the
hardware for the first E-FIELD Flames tests because of the initial use of the same coflow burner.
Planning is critical because crew activity is scheduled three weeks in advance, for which detailed
procedures must be prepared and uplinked to the ISS.

All CIR tests are remotely commanded from the ground from NASA's Glenn ISS Payload Operations
Center (GIPOC) in Cleveland, Ohio. Typically, four to six people staff four consoles during the
testing. The CIR hardware is controlled from the Rack Officer (RO) and Data Management Officer
(DMO) consoles, and the ACME hardware is controlled from the Payload Developer (PD) console.
Two shifts of personnel are scheduled to staff these three consoles on test days because they
typically last 14 hours with the many pre- and post-testing activities. Given that the tests are
remotely commanded, the operations are carried out in the day and evening in Cleveland, e.g.,
from 7 AM to 9 PM. A day's tests, i.e., with flames, are normally conducted in a period of 10 hours
of less. Tests are normally conducted on three weekdays per two weeks. On intervening
weekdays, the image data is downlinked and the crew often swap one or both gas bottles.
Transferring and downlinking data from a day's tests also requires a 2-shift day for the RO and
DMO consoles, where it is always necessary to verify that data was downlinked without errors
and that data is not missing. Those two positions are also staffed to guide and oversee the crew
activity. As a result, the CIR consoles are normally actively staffed on four weekdays per week. A
team of four carry out the detailed planning for the CIR and ACME console staff, and the daily
operational plans typically exceed 50 pages on days including testing.


The science console allows for review of the analog video and non-imaging telemetry (at 1 Hz) in
near real time but doesn't allow for commanding. In the case of E-FIELD Flames, arrangements
were made so that the analog video is streamed to a secure computer at UC Irvine to allow the
research team to participate in test operations and to recommend adjustments to the day's
planned parameters. That team does not see the telemetry during the testing, but is in
communication via phone and e-mail with their NASA research partners at the GRC ISS Payload
Operations Center (GIPOC). While there are many preparatory steps, the tests are ultimately
conducted using an uploaded software script and parameter files. In advance of the test day, the
UC Irvine science team plans the nearly 60 parameters in the voltage sweep script and specifies
other parameters that are configured outside of the script, such as camera settings. It is also
possible to effectively conduct tests in a 'manual' mode, where parameters are changed in
response to the analog video downlink or telemetry. For example, the electric field potential can
be adjusted to approach a stability or soot limit.

Typically, ten E-FIELD Flames tests are conducted per test day. Despite the short test durations,
the low rate results from several unavoidable factors. After a test is conducted, the 125-Hz non-
imaging data is downlinked for immediate review by the science team. A small sample of images
are often downlinked to ensure that the camera exposures are appropriate, where the times for
those images are typically selected based on non-imaging data to provide extreme examples. The
review helps to verify parameters or plan for adjustments in subsequent tests, e.g., to select the
voltage range after determining where the ion current saturates for the given flame conditions.
After a test is conducted, a fan circulates the chamber atmosphere after which the chamber is
vented (to space) back to atmospheric pressure, if needed. Midway through a day's E-FIELD
Flames tests, the atmosphere is circulated for 15 minutes through a filter cartridge filled with
molecular sieves to capture any soot and adsorb at least a portion of the combustion products,

Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) System. Depending on the various orbits, there are periodic
communication outages with a loss of signal (LOS) that can be a short handover (from one satellite

A variety of constraints limit the number of tests that can be performed, both overall and on a
daily basis. The next combustion experiments in the CIR will feature solid fuels and focus on flame
spread and material flammability. That follow-on plan limits the duration of ACME operations,
where each ACME experiment is allotted four months for testing. Although it requires additional
crew time, these allotments are split into two rounds so that the investigators have a break from
testing for careful review of the early results so that they can maximize the scientific outcome of
their second round. This paper reports on early results from the first round of E-FIELD Flames.


While nitrogen is available from the space station, the combustion testing is limited by the
available gas bottles that were and are launched to support the tests. For E-FIELD Flames and
most of ACME's experiments, the test matrices used to plan those gas resources were established
in 2010. At that time, NASA limited the scope of the ACME tests matrices with the intent of
focused experiments with limited objectives rather than comprehensive experiments. As such,
the general target was 50 tests per experiment. For most ACME experiments, the limiting gas
constraint is the oxygen/nitrogen bottles used to fill the chamber. This resource constraint is
exacerbated by the CIR because it is equipped with a pair of redundant safety timers to limit the
fuel that can flow into the combustion chamber (where the timers can be set for the oxidizer flow
in the case of inverse flame testing). The timers can only be reset by venting the combustion
chamber. Therefore, the timer limit combined with other constraints effectively corresponds to
the day's maximum flow time for the fuel (or more generally, the limiting reactant). For E-FIELD
Flames, the safety timers are set to the maximum value of 999 seconds, which corresponds to the
10 tests typically completed per day.

and gas resources are needed to vent and refill the chamber and still conduct tests afterward, but
this was done on most BRE test days. The only exceptions were 19039, 19063, and 19091 where
in the last case no flames were ignited because the igniter had unknowingly failed at the end of
the prior test day.


Another constraint is the available time in a day, where the console personnel and ISS resources,
such as the video downlink, are planned for a limited number of hours. When necessary for the
research, NASA does have continuous 24-hour/day operations for some non-CIR experiments.
But as discussed, the ACME tests are typically two minutes or less in duration, so the testing is
almost always limited to the planned durations.


Data limits are yet another constraint, where the on-orbit hardware can store a limited amount
of data. More importantly, 127,000 MB is the most that can be reasonably managed in a two-
shift transfer and downlink day. Therefore, tests days are limited to this amount of data, where
image data from select cameras is often archived at reduced rates to mitigate this challenge.
Nonetheless, the limit sometimes forces decisions to abandon recorded images.


This detailed description of operations and hardware provides the context under which the ACME
experiments are conducted. ...


Meanwhile, Table 1 is a summary log of the flames ignited, including a limited overview of the test
conditions, where it is an excerpt from this report's Appendix E. 30-Day Operational
Accomplishments Report for ISS Increment 64. Note that it is comprehensive and includes the
earlier testing conducted in the preceding increments. A minor correction was made where 19094
is now identified as April 4. It accidentally been identified as April 5 in the 30-day reports, although
the testing did extend past midnight in Cleveland, OH so the final tests were conducted on April 5.
Nonetheless, the BRE (and more generally ACME) test days and numbers are identified by the date
on which the test day began, even if they occurred after midnight (whether on the ISS or in
Cleveland).

# C. Summary of Preliminary Results


Figure 6 shows a typical test of ignition and flame growth. Although extinction occurred at 45 s
with the flame still growing, the heat flux was nearly steady by 30 s. Therefore, a heat of
gasification (L) could be estimated. This was done by using the arithmetic average of the center
and offset heat flux sensor as the net average heat flux.


Figure 6. Flame growth from ignition to self-extinction in test 19056F1. The conditions are
ethylene/N2, hc = 24 kJ/g, 4.55 g/m2s, 27% O2, 10.2 psia, L = 0.66 kJ/g, extinction at 45 s.


Figures 7 through 10 illustrate results for nominal atmospheric conditions of 26.5% oxygen and
0.7 atm (10.2 psia), and 34% oxygen and 0.56 atm (8.2 psia), respectively with two figures each.
Both use 50% mixtures of nitrogen and ethylene giving a fuel mixture heat of combustion of 24
kJ/g. Both tests reached quasi-steady conditions and were terminated by shutting off the fuel.
The plots of transient heat flux shown by Figures 8 and 10, show the condensation effect removed
after 80 s and 40 s respectively and arithmetic average of the two heat flux gauge measurements
at the end of each test is recorded as steady surface heat flux which are used to obtain heats of
gasification.

In Figures 9 and 11 the flame reaches a quasi-steady state in about 80 seconds as seen by the
flame shape and the heat flux data. This emulation corresponds to a material with a heat of
combustion of about 24 kJ/g and a heat of gasification of about 3 kJ/g. As such it could represent
PMMA as a material solid. This is a profound result indicating a common plastic could steadily
burn under these NASA proposed atmospheric conditions.

Figure 9 shows steady results for a NASA proposed nominal atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 0.56

as 2.42 kJ/g.

Radiative loss fraction from the flames are obtained using the radiometer's measurements.
Unfortunately, the data set is limited as the BRE sensors were saturated for several tests. The +60
mm and the offset radiometers were used to obtain the radiative loss fraction as these two
sensors provided data in multiple cases while the other two radiometers were saturated. The
transient radiative loss fraction for 19066D5 and 19070L1 are shown in Figure 10 for both
radiometers, which show good agreement with each other. Table 3 provides information about
the test conditions. As BRE radiometers were out of range for many tests of round 1, BRE
radiometer array was replaced with ACME array to possibly prevent sensors from saturation. The
offset radiometer data has been analyzed and the results are presented in Fig. 11.

Flame heights at the end of the tests are measured from the image data. The radiative loss
fraction is correlated with flame height as shown in Fig 12 (b). As more design parameters are
included in the radiation analysis (i.e., oxygen mole fraction, pressure, and mass flux), more
accurate empirical relationship was found between radiative loss fraction and a dimensionless
parameter . The results are shown in Figure 12. Radiative loss fraction was calculated for all
tests using the parameters shown in Fig. 12 (a) and the results were compared to the measured
values; see Fig. 13.

The experimental flammability maps are shown in Figures 14 and 15. Both plots indicate a
decreasing, inverse asymptotic-like curve that approaches zero, for heat of gasification with mass
flux. It is surprising that the data cluster about a nearly singular trend. However, both plots show
the heat of gasification is up to 20% higher for the lower heat of combustion, 23.6 kJ/g. Our
experiments in the University of Maryland lab have shown, with the BRE in 1-g, that similar results
for propane-nitrogen mixtures have the opposite behavior with heats of gasification decreasing
with heat of combustion for the same mass flux. But again, the data mostly cluster about one
trend line except for very low heats of combustion. However, the 1-g corresponding heat of
combustion data shift far to the right and down from the microgravity data of Figures 14 and 15.
For example, the 1-g data would indicate ( 𝑚̇ ", 𝐿) points of about 30 g/m2s, 2 kJ/g and 10, 0.5.
Moreover, our previous work in a 5- s drop facility suggested similar data trends but with an
apparent vertical asymptote at about 3 g/m2s, rather than 1 as shown here. Obviously, the
current data at durations of minutes are more accurate than those limited to 5 s. However, it has
been shown that the ISS heat flux data even at self-extinction are theoretically nearly steady.
Figures 14 and 15 include the heats of gasification derived from the self-extinguished endpoint
data as well. Remarkably, the self-extinguished not-so-steady data follow the same trend as the
steady data.


Let us interpret Figures 14 and 15 in terms of the flammability of real materials in microgravity.
Typical melting plastics have heats of gasification ranging from about 2 to 3 kJ/g, with effective
heats of gasification for charring plastics above 4 kJ/g. Some selected literature values for
materials with heats of combustion in the BRE range are listed in Table 2. The accuracy of the
calorimeter heat flux is found to be less than the two sensors, thus, we relied on the arithmetic
average of the two heat flux sensors data for obtaining the flammability map. However, same
results are shown considering the calorimeter data. Figure 14 would suggest that polyethylene
(PE) and polypropylene (PP) would burn in microgravity at about 3 g/m2s. Nylon and PMMA would
burn at about 2.5 g/m2s, and the phenolic glass fiber composite would burn at about 1 g/m2s.

BRE tests in orbit were finished with 196 successful ignitions. The measured heat flux and the end
point data of the long duration tests (i.e., the tests that fuel was terminated as opposed to the
tests that self-extinguished) were used to obtain heats of gasification. The measured heat flux for
all quasi steady tests are shown in Fig. 14. The heats of gasification of these data from all the tests
vs. fuel mixture mass flux are shown in Fig. 15. One important fire safety consideration, based on
the findings of this study, is that solid materials with heats of combustion in the range 23.6 to 47.2
kJ/g and heats of gasification from about 1 to 10 kJ/g can burn in microgravity. The NASA
alternative flammability Test 2 [1] using the Cone Calorimeter can measure these material
properties. As this study develops a more complete understanding, NASA may wish to put more
emphasis into Test 2.

Regression analysis was performed on the experimental data recorded from the quasi-steady
tests and the burning rate vs. parameter  is shown in Fig. 16. The symbol  indicates the
importance of each design parameter. As shown, the oxygen mole fraction, radiant fraction, and
heat of gasification are the factors with largest exponents. The larger the exponent, the greater
its effect on the burning rate.


Moreover, the flammability map based on our theoretical analysis is shown in Figure 17. It shows
similar asymptotic trend and clearly indicates lower pressure and higher oxygen concentration as
favorable conditions for long duration burning.

The imaging data from ops camera and ACME camera are used to create videos and image
sequences for the tests. Many of the first tests with the 50-mm BRE burner were not at the
intended flow rate. A make-up day was carried out to accomplish that day's scientific objectives.
The plan for round 2's second day contained a combination of pure and diluted ethylene at 3
different ambient conditions. Pure methane was the fuel used for testing on the second round's
third test day at 3 different nominal ambient conditions. It was observed that methane was hard
to ignite compared to ethylene and flames tend to self-extinguish faster even at a high oxygen
concentration.


Our preliminary analysis on the calculated vs. measured heats of gasification led to the
comparison plot shown in Figure 18 which contains all the tests with quasi-steady data.

Figure 18. Convective heat flux on the burner surface obtained by the View Factor method for
nominal ambient conditions used for round 1 BRE tests on the ISS.


As the two major factors used to emulate real fuel are heats of gasification and heats of
combustion, the plot of the former parameter vs. the latter was developed to identify a region for
possibility of flammability that changes with ambient oxygen mole fraction. Thus, oxygen mole
fraction will be included as a third dimension to make the plot more clear, but this is still in
progress. The preliminary results for all quasi-steady data points are shown in Fig. 19.

# D. Surprises and New Discoveries


Initial surprises and discoveries include:


1. It is found out that quasi-steady burning on a flat surface, representing a pool fire, can exist in microgravity. Ambient oxygen mole fraction plays the most significant role in this regard. The quasi-steady flames were observed for nominal ambient oxygen mole fractions of 0.265 and above.

2. Although ambient pressure has a weak effect on the quality of burning, it affects radiative heat loss by changing the partial pressures of radiating species, i.e., H2O and CO2.

3. Methane nitrogen-generated flames self-extinguished within a minute for all ambient conditions. That indicates that the burn time depends on the fuel chemistry.

4. Ethylene flames, which tend to soot under normal gravity conditions, did not soot under microgravity conditions. Sooting only occurred upon ignition and disappeared quickly after ignition. Nitrogen dilution reduced the amount of soot.

5. Radiative loss fraction for the flames in microgravity can reach about 60% compared to 30% for the normal gravity flames.

6. TFP measurements of four flames confirmed that critical temperature range for extinction is 1100 to 1200 K. This is confirmed by numerical simulations.

7. A It was shown that the BRE can emulate several liquids and solids including Acetone, Ethanol, Methanol, PMMA, Nylon, Phenolic glass fiber, etc. as demonstrated by a flammability diagram, as a plot of heats of gasification vs. the mass burning rate, based on the steady average surface heat flux.

8. For the first time, two limits of extinction were obtained on a plot of heat of combustion vs. heats of gasification. The plot shows the flammability region for each nominal ambient oxygen mole fraction with radiative extinction for large flames and another extinction limit for small flames.


# E. Accomplishment of Approved Objectives


Two of the three approved objectives were accomplished through the ISS experiment,
where NASA did not intend to address the desired second objective through the
investigation.

# F. Additional Objectives Achieved


An empirical correlation for the radiative loss fraction was obtained through a dimensional
analysis of the radiation data. The correlation was used to predict the flames' radiative loss
fractions from their mass burning rate, oxygen mole fraction in the ambient, chamber pressure,
and heat of combustion. This result was used to correct the heat of combustion in the analytical
solution for these flames.


# G. Impacts, Benefits, and Products


BRE yielded important data relevant to spacecraft fire safety. Quasi-steady burning
corresponding to various condensed-phase materials (such as PMMA and Nylon) was observed in
microgravity despite the absence of air flow, where the cessation of ventilation is an established
step in putting out spacecraft fires. The ongoing combustion without air flow was notably seen
in elevated-oxygen atmospheres which are being considered for use in future spacecraft, whereas
such flames in a normal atmosphere of 21% oxygen self-extinguished in a short time.


While BRE's results are still preliminary, they suggest that NASA may want to increase use of its
alternative flammability Test 2, with the cone calorimeter, where that test can measure material
properties corresponding to the microgravity flames observed with the BRE burner.


# H. Patents


Thus far, no patents have been filed from the BRE research.

# 5. Follow-On Experiments


A study of the burning behavior in an ambient of O2/CO2 (the desired objective) is a good candidate for
a follow-on experiment because of the utility of CO2 in spacecraft fire extinguishers. We would also like
to expand the testing to include propane and propylene to emulate additional condensed fuels.
Furthermore, the addition of external radiation to the experimental apparatus would improve the
simulation of real fires.

# I. Introduction


The Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment is conducted in the Combustion Integrated Rack
(CIR) on the International Space Station, as part of the Advanced Combustion via Microgravity
Experiments (ACME) project. BRE is focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically,
BRE's goals are to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability, such as
extinction behavior and the conditions needed for sustained combustion, and to assess the
relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. A flat
porous burner fed with gaseous fuel simulates the burning of solid and liquid fuels, where
measurements are made of the thermal feedback (i.e., to the burner) upon which the
vaporization of condensed-phase fuels is dependent. A small number of gaseous fuels (including
mixtures with inert gases) are used to simulate the burning of fuels such as paper, plastic, and
alcohol by matching properties including the heats of combustion and gasification, the surface
temperature, and smoke point. The experiment's results can establish fuel properties that


45




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


directly relate to fire hazards in spacecraft, and if effective in microgravity could provide an
efficient, safe, and comprehensive technique for assessing flammability and selecting fire-
resistant spacecraft materials.
BRE's specific experimental objectives are as follows, where it must be emphasized that NASA
does not currently plan to carry out the desired tests for objective B.


1. Observe burning behavior in long-duration microgravity for CH4/N2 and C2H4/N2 mixtures on porous circular burners of 25 and 50 mm diameter. Consider O2/N2 ambients with various pressures and ambient O2 concentrations and pressures. NASA-considered atmosphere for human space missions will be examined: 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen; 10.2 psia, 26.5 %; and 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. Emphasize fuel conditions that can be related to a diverse range of condensed fuels.

2. Consider the conditions of Objective 1 for ambients of O2/CO2 (desired).

3. Consider the conditions of Objectives 1 - 2 for extinction limits.


The observations will enable quantification of the microgravity behavior of condensed fuels (i.e.,
liquids and non-charring plastics).


Microgravity studies of flames allow for a range of simplifications and provide various advantages
over normal-gravity studies. For example, the flicker of flame, which is a buoyancy-driven (i.e.,
gravity-driven) instability, is eliminated yielding quasi-steady flames in microgravity. Length
scales are increased in microgravity flames facilitating analysis of the flame structure.
Momentum-dominated flames, which are important for most practical combustion, can be
studied at low velocities to simplify analysis. Microgravity flames tend to have a much stronger
sensitivity to their atmosphere and exhibit a much broader range of characteristics than normal-
gravity flames because of the near absence of buoyant entrainment. The long residence times in
microgravity flames can lead to strong soot production, but many microgravity flames are soot
free. The absence of buoyancy makes microgravity flames advantageous for studies of limit and
stability behavior where chemical kinetics are important. With these advantages, microgravity
testing can lead to new understanding of the complex nature of combustion - regardless of the
gravitational environment of the combustion application.


# II. Methods/Research Operations


# A. Discussion of Method/Protocol


BRE and other ACME experiments are configured, but not conducted, by the ISS crew.
The crew's role is to set up the hardware, gas bottles, etc. for each set of tests. The most
common changes include the gas bottles on the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) and
the mass flow controllers on the modular ACME chamber insert.


All testing is commanded from the ground, specifically from the Glenn ISS Payload
Operations Center (GIPOC). The science portion of the testing is typically conducted in a
nominally automated mode using pre-programmed scripts. However, it may alternately
be conducted in a 'manual' mode, where changes are made to a control parameter in


46




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

response to the analog video downlink and the numerical data available in the telemetry
stream. For example, gas flow rate(s) can be adjusted after quasi-steady data has been
collected. But testing has not been conducted in a 'manual' mode thus far for BRE or
ACME in general.


Testing is not conducted when thrusters fire or spacecraft dock or undock from ISS to
ensure an acceptable acceleration environment.


Data is downlinked between each set of tests, i.e., day of testing, to allow for preliminary
analysis and requisite planning for subsequent testing.


# III. Results A. Baselined Activities Completed - Pre-flight, In-flight, Post-Flight


The first round of BRE tests began in February 2019, where a total of 45 flames were
ignited during Increment 58. That round was completed in April 2019, where the latter
portion will be covered in the upcoming Increment 59-60 report. Meanwhile, the second
round of BRE testing is expected to begin near the end of Increment 60 and continue into
Increment 61. The 'interruption' in the BRE testing was intentionally planned years in
advance to enable the PI team to review the initial results in detail and with that
knowledge plan the second round of tests to maximize its scientific outcome.


All of the first round of tests were conducted with the 25-mm diameter BRE burner while
burning ethylene (C2H4) - sometimes diluted with nitrogen. The tests were carried out
at a range of chamber pressures and oxygen concentrations, generally representative of
possible crew environments in future spacecraft or habitats. More specifically, testing
was especially focused on atmospheric conditions at (1) 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen; (2) 10.2
psia, 26.5 %; and (3) 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. In all cases, the atmosphere was diluted with
nitrogen and any incomplete combustion products (e.g., water vapor and carbon dioxide)
from preceding tests.


BRE does not have living subjects like a life science experiment, but the tests are
independently conducted with two different gaseous fuels, methane and ethylene. Both
are simple hydrocarbon gases for which the chemistry is well understood. Methane (CH4)
is the primary component of natural gas and tends to produce low levels of soot given the
absence of carbon-carbon bonds. Meanwhile, ethylene (C2H4), is highly sooting because
of its carbon double bond. Tests are conducted with pure fuel and fuel mixed with
nitrogen, where the fuel and nitrogen was premixed on the ground prior to launch for
some cases. But the ACME hardware also allows for simultaneous flow of fuel and
nitrogen to the burner, allowing for on-orbit fuel dilution and testing at a continuum of
fuel concentrations.

There are no samples (e.g., of soot) collected for BRE, where all of the ISS results are
electronically transmitted to the ground. That is furthermore the case for all currently
planned ACME experiments.

There were no significant anomalies hindering BRE operations during

# 2. Any other difficulties in obtaining scientific data


BRE's primary problem was that the sensors for measuring the thermal radiation often
saturated. Although the measurements were not required to meet experiment
success, they were considered sufficiently critical that BRE was equipped with its own
radiometer array, featuring three thermopile detectors. Estimates had been made of
the signal levels based on 5-second drop tests since the hot gases tend to blanket the
flame in the absence of buoyancy and thereby remain within the view of the
radiometers. As a result, the signal levels are strongly dependent on gravity. The
estimates were not part of the science requirements and may not have been
sufficiently tracked in the hardware development. Furthermore, the ISS tests lasted
as long as 5 minutes, which is over four times the envisioned BRE test duration and 60

times the duration of the drop tests. With the fixed amplification of the radiometer
signals, the data was frequently lost - other than the knowledge that the limits were
exceeded. An engineering review failed to identify an acceptable solution and BRE
testing continued unchanged.

Ignition was not always successful, where BRE tests were sometimes conducted under
conditions, e.g., for igniter activation and deactivation, which led to momentary
flashes without sustained ignition. Given that unplanned crew time is required to
replace failed igniter tips, the BRE ops team limited - to varying degrees - the igniter
voltage and the time that it was energized within the flame. The latter was known
from earlier research in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to degrade the hot-wire
igniter tip and hasten its demise. It is notable that the flashes of flame (across the
burner surface) sometimes continued briefly after the igniter was deactivated and
retracted. In one case on the first day of testing, there was excess fuel and a 'fireball'
was ignited which promptly quenched. Ignition also sometimes failed due to a
software limitation where the fuelFlowIgnitionDeltaMs parameter which specifies the
relative timing of the fuel flow and igniter activation must be evenly divisible by 100
(ms). This limitation wasn't initially understood and the igniter didn't energize as a
result.

The second day of flame testing was delayed to allow for the development of a new
ignition procedure, where concerns arose that the mixture of gas flowing from the
burner wasn't sufficiently well understood, i.e., in terms of concentrations. This
concern had to do with the burner's large internal volume relative to that of the
burners used for the other ACME experiments. To be clear, this issue had to do with
the analysis of results rather than the achievement of ignition. Re-planning was also
necessary early in BRE testing because the test durations were often much longer than
had earlier been envisioned by the investigators. While these factors didn't directly
interfere with the acquisition of test data, they did slow progress.


While it rarely occurred, BRE tests sometimes automatically aborted (due to the
controlling software script), where that is typically prior to gas flow and the activation
of the igniter. As a result, there is little lost other than the time associated with the
failed test attempt. Such aborts typically occur because of communication issues with
an Image Processing and Storage Unit (IPSU).


ACME's Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) used to control the flow of fuel and nitrogen
have unfortunately not always performed adequately, where the flow rates have not
always been appropriately steady. The resulting effects on the flame behavior are
tentatively assumed to be minor, but this still needs to be assessed.


# C. Completeness/Quality of Data


The number of flames ignited significantly exceeds the planned tests - under the tested
conditions (25-mm burner and ethylene as fuel) - which were specified as required in the
ACME Integrated Science Requirements Document (ISRD). A total of 25 such tests were
required, while 45 flames were ignited in the Increment 58 portion of the experiment's
first round. As such, roughly 80% more flames were ignited than had been planned even
though the round hadn't been completed.


It should be understood that a complete set of image data is not necessarily available for
all tests. Recorded image data is sometimes deleted without downlinking. This is done
because of operational constraints which limit the amount of data that can be managed
per test day. Given the constraint, the decision is sometimes made to sacrifice some
image data (e.g., from the HiBMs camera) to allow additional tests to be conducted. This
is intentionally done in order to maximize the scientific return of each day of testing
within the project constraints.

Data quality is of course dependent on the experimental hardware. But neglecting that
limitation on data quality, the cameras are sensitive to radiation where pixels gradually
become 'hot' over time. While these bright spots are addressed in image post-processing,
they are a degradation of the image quality.


See discussion in III.D in regard to fouling or degradation of the paint on the BRE burner's
thermopile sensors.


It is possible that the tests are subtly affected by the acceleration environment, but there
is not obvious indication of this and it has thus far not been evaluated with available
measurements from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). In this regard,
note that the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), in which the experiment is conducted, is
equipped with a Passive Rack Isolation System (PaRIS).


Regardless of the shortcomings discussed above, a great wealth of experimental data has
been secured and BRE's first round (which ended in Increment 59) is considered to be
successful despite the frequent saturation of the radiometer data discussed in section

The first technique uses two thermopile heat flux gages embedded in the burner surface.
One gage is at the center the other is offset from the center. The resulting data suffered
from two possible effects. The first effect is the condensation of water vapor. As the
sensors are not cooled, but rise with temperature as the flame grows, water from its
combustion products can condense and then evaporate from the sensor. This occurs, as
the dew point for combustion products is about 60 - 70 oC, and the sensor begins at
ambient temperature and can achieve temperatures over 100 oC. Thus condensation can
occur at temperatures below the dew point that leads to added heat to the sensor. Above
the dew point, the condensed water will evaporate and reduce the heat to the sensor.
Once the sensor is dry, it will only measure the heat flux from the flame gases as intended.


We have duplicated this condensation effect in 1-g laboratory experiments with our
duplicative NASA BRE burner. The figure below (Fig. 1) shows an illustration of the
condensation and evaporation effect in the ISS tests. The offset sensor in red shows a
clear jump increase when the water fully evaporates. More analysis is needed to
properly correct for this effect. Fortunately by the end of the test shown here (and for all
of the other data), this water effect is gone.


Figure 1. Typical net heat flux of thermopile sensors


The second effect on the thermopile sensors is that the heat may have fouled their paint.
This could then affect their calibration. Figure 2 shows an enlargement of the burner after
Round 1 tests were concluded. It can be seen that the paint on the sensors is degraded.
This was the original manufacturer's paint, instead of that used for the copper top. The
copper paint appears fine. We are working with the thermopile manufacturer to explore
the effect of heat damage on the calibration of the thermopile sensors. This will give us
a way to determine a quantitative change in the calibration.


52




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

Figure 2. Paint degradation on thermopile


sensors


The second technique to determine the heat flux is the copper calorimeter forming the
top of the burner. The temperature rise of the copper is key to that determination. The
next figure (Fig. 3) shows that typically the copper temperature is nearly uniform and
smooth in time. It does not appear that condensation or evaporation is having any effect
on its temperature behavior. So we believe we are justified in using this measurement to
predict the overall average heat flux from the flame to the burner. However, we do need
to evaluate any possible effect of the combustion product water. In addition, these
calorimeter data are not fully processed yet because we are refining our methodology for
its calibration. If the thermopile data cannot be completely used with good accuracy, we
have the calorimeter to fall back on.

Figure 3. Copper and heat flux sensor temperatures, Day 6, D1


Preliminary analysis of the radiometer sensor data has indicated its consistent ability to
measure the flame overall radiation heat loss fraction. The method to determine the
radiative heat flux component to the burner is more complex, and it will rely on
theoretical modeling. This will take some time.


The video images of all the flames have been compiled, and are being quantified in term
of shape and dimensions.


Alexander Snegirev, our Russian partner, has attempted a numerical simulation of at least
one of the ISS BRE tests. That work is still in progress. It should be remarked his student
won the Student Prize for Best Presentation at the 9th International Seminar on Fire and
Explosion Hazards, St. Petersburg, April 2019 for simulating our 5-s BRE drop tests.


1. Preliminary Research Findings (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere) Despite having much data to digest and completely analyze, there is a profound conclusion from these tests. The burner has definitively shown that steady burning is possible for real solids with a flat surface of 25 mm diameter. Up to now most flammability studies in microgravity have focused on flame spread with a wind for concurrent spread and at least a self-induced wind for opposed flow spread. We already knew that this would be possible from 1-g research. The burning of liquids, as in a wick of a candle flame and small droplets, has been shown to produce steady flames. However, in the case of droplet burning cool flames could sustain normal burning, and normal burning would extinguish. The extinction has been shown to result from the radiative cooling of the flame. We see this as well in the extended ISS microgravity tests. However this extinction was predominately seen for atmospheric conditions of 21 %

oxygen and 14.7 psia. At conditions of 27 % oxygen, 10.2 psia and 34 % oxygen, 8.2 psia,
the flames mostly persisted for 2 minutes or more as steady. These are all atmospheric
conditions that NASA may use. Some examples will be shown to illustrate results over
these atmospheres.

Figure 4. Day 3, Test F1. Flame growth from ignition to self-extinction


Figure 4 shows a typical test of ignition and flame growth. Although extinction occurred
at 45 s with the flame still growing, the heat flux was nearly steady by 30 s. Therefore a
heat of gasification (L) could be estimated. This was done in a preliminary estimation by
using the center heat flux sensor as the net average heat flux. If the heating is just due to
diffusion, theory indicates that the average heat flux is double the center value. Hence
such an estimated heat of gasification could be low by 50 %. On the other hand, if the
sensor is degraded in its calibration and radiation is a significant component of the heat
flux, then the estimate will also be low. Hence, using the center heat flux sensor directly
gives a conservatively low estimate of the heat of gasification in the emulation of real
solids. This will be significant when the totality of results for the 25 mm flat burning
surface is display over its spectrum of conservatively low values for L.


Figures 5 and 6 illustrate results for atmospheric conditions of 26.5 % oxygen and 0.7 atm


(10.2 psia), and 34 % oxygen and 0.56 atm (8.2 psia), respectively. Both use 50 % mixtures


of nitrogen and ethylene giving a fuel mixture heat of combustion of 21.8 kJ/g. Both of
these tests reached steady conditions and were terminated by shutting off the fuel.

could steadily burn under these NASA proposed atmospheric conditions. Let us examine
another case.

only discriminating by oxygen concentrations, Figure 7 shows a dramatic result. The fuel
mixture mass flux is plotted against the estimated value of the center heat flux reading at
the end of the test, as it appeared steady. As stated in the figure all of the flames at 21 %
oxygen led to self-extinction in less than about 25 s, most of the flames at 27 % oxygen
and all of the flames at 34 % oxygen reached steady burning. As stated earlier, the
estimate for the heat of gasification could be low in this preliminary presentation;
however, the range of L values displayed in Figure 7 clearly shows that it includes nearly

# I. Introduction


The Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment is conducted in the Combustion Integrated Rack
(CIR) on the International Space Station, as part of the Advanced Combustion via Microgravity
Experiments (ACME) project. BRE is focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically,
BRE's goals are to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability, such as
extinction behavior and the conditions needed for sustained combustion, and to assess the
relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. A flat
porous burner fed with gaseous fuel simulates the burning of solid and liquid fuels, where
measurements are made of the thermal feedback (i.e., to the burner) upon which the
vaporization of condensed-phase fuels is dependent. A small number of gaseous fuels (including
mixtures with inert gases) are used to simulate the burning of fuels such as paper, plastic, and

alcohol by matching properties including the heats of combustion and gasification, the surface
temperature, and smoke point. The experiment's results can establish fuel properties that
directly relate to fire hazards in spacecraft, and if effective in microgravity could provide an
efficient, safe, and comprehensive technique for assessing flammability and selecting fire-
resistant spacecraft materials.


BRE's specific experimental objectives are as follows, where it must be emphasized that NASA
does not currently plan to carry out the desired tests for objective B.


1. Observe burning behavior in long-duration microgravity for CH4/N2 and C2H4/N2 mixtures on porous circular burners of 25 and 50 mm diameter. Consider O2/N2 ambients with various pressures and ambient O2 concentrations and pressures. NASA-considered atmosphere for human space missions will be examined: 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen; 10.2 psia, 26.5 %; and 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. Emphasize fuel conditions that can be related to a diverse range of condensed fuels.

2. Consider the conditions of Objective 1 for ambients of O2/CO2 (desired).

3. Consider the conditions of Objectives 1 - 2 for extinction limits.


The observations will enable quantification of the microgravity behavior of condensed fuels (i.e.,
liquids and non-charring plastics).


Microgravity studies of flames allow for a range of simplifications and provide various advantages
over normal-gravity studies. For example, the flicker of flame, which is a buoyancy-driven (i.e.,
gravity-driven) instability, is eliminated yielding quasi-steady flames in microgravity. Length
scales are increased in microgravity flames facilitating analysis of the flame structure.
Momentum-dominated flames, which are important for most practical combustion, can be
studied at low velocities to simplify analysis. Microgravity flames tend to have a much stronger
sensitivity to their atmosphere and exhibit a much broader range of characteristics than normal-
gravity flames because of the near absence of buoyant entrainment. The long residence times in
microgravity flames can lead to strong soot production, but many microgravity flames are soot
free. The absence of buoyancy makes microgravity flames advantageous for studies of limit and
stability behavior where chemical kinetics are important. With these advantages, microgravity
testing can lead to new understanding of the complex nature of combustion - regardless of the
gravitational environment of the combustion application.


# II. Methods/Research Operations


# A. Discussion of Method/Protocol


BRE and other ACME experiments are configured, but not conducted, by the ISS crew.
The crew's role is to set up the hardware, gas bottles, etc. for each set of tests. The most
common changes include the gas bottles on the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) and
the mass flow controllers on the modular ACME chamber insert.

All testing is commanded from the ground, specifically from the operations center at the
NASA Glenn Research Center. The science portion of the testing is typically conducted in
a nominally automated mode using pre-programmed scripts. However, it may alternately
be conducted in a 'manual' mode, where changes are made to a control parameter in
response to the analog video downlink and the numerical data available in the telemetry
stream. For example, gas flow rate(s) can be adjusted after quasi-steady data has been
collected. But testing has not been conducted in a 'manual' mode thus far for BRE or
ACME in general.


Testing is not conducted when thrusters fire or spacecraft dock or undock from ISS to
ensure an acceptable acceleration environment.


Data is downlinked between each set of tests, i.e., day of testing, to allow for preliminary
analysis and requisite planning for subsequent testing.


# III. Results A. Baselined Activities Completed - Pre-flight, In-flight, Post-Flight


The first round of BRE tests began in February 2019, where a total of 45 flames were
ignited during Increment 58. That round was completed in April 2019, during the
beginning of Increment 59, when an additional 17 flames were ignited. As such, a total
of 62 flames were ignited in the first round of testing. Meanwhile, the second round of
BRE testing is expected to begin near the end of Increment 61 and continue into
Increment 62. The 'interruption' in the BRE testing was intentionally planned years in
advance to enable the PI team to review the initial results in detail and with that
knowledge plan the second round of tests to maximize its scientific outcome.


All of the first round of tests were conducted with the 25-mm diameter BRE burner while
burning ethylene (C2H4) - sometimes diluted with nitrogen. The tests were carried out
at a range of chamber pressures and oxygen concentrations, generally representative of
possible crew environments in future spacecraft or habitats. More specifically, testing
was especially focused on atmospheric conditions at (1) 14.7 psia, 21% oxygen; (2)


10.2 psia, 26.5% oxygen; and (3) 8.2 psia, 34% oxygen. In all cases, the atmosphere was


diluted with nitrogen and any incomplete combustion products (e.g., water vapor and
carbon dioxide) from preceding tests. An exception is tests conducted after the chamber
atmosphere was vented and refilled, such as the first test of the day. But the atmosphere
was typically refreshed once during each of testing.


BRE does not have living subjects like a life science experiment. The tests are
independently conducted with two different gaseous fuels, methane and ethylene. Both
are simple hydrocarbon gases for which the chemistry is well understood. Methane (CH4)
is the primary component of natural gas and tends to produce low levels of soot given the
absence of carbon-carbon bonds. Meanwhile, ethylene (C2H4), is normally highly sooting


62




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

because of its carbon double bond. Tests are conducted with pure fuel and fuel mixed
with nitrogen, where the fuel and nitrogen was premixed on the ground prior to launch
for some cases. But the ACME hardware also allows for simultaneous flow of fuel and
nitrogen to the burner, allowing for on-orbit fuel dilution and testing at a continuum of
fuel concentrations.


There are no samples (e.g., of soot) collected for BRE, where all of the ISS results are
electronically transmitted to the ground. That is furthermore the case for all currently
planned ACME experiments.


A summary log of the flames ignited for BRE during the first round of testing - in
Increments 58 and 59 - is found in Table 1. The table includes a limited overview of the
test conditions. For completeness, a row was included for testing on April 1 (GMT 091)
even though it was quickly discovered that the hot-wire igniter tip had failed at the end
of the preceding test day. As a result, flames were not ignited until a few days later after
astronaut Nick Hague had replaced the igniter tip.

# B. List of Preflight, In-flight, Postflight Anomalies


# 1. Mission anomalies


There were no significant anomalies hindering BRE operations during Increment 59,
but there was one in Increment 58 during the preparations for BRE testing began (that
was mistakenly not addressed in the 30-day report including that increment). It was
discovered on Feb. 4 (GMT 035) that the pressure was low in a check gas bottle for
the CIR's Gas Chromatograph Instrumentation Package (GCIP). The bottle had been
on the space station for 9 years, and the low pressure was attributed to a nominal
leak rate. The check gas was for calibration of the GCIP measurements and not
needed for regular operations which proceeded unhindered. The bottle was replaced
on June 13 to enable the necessary calibration.


2. Any other difficulties in obtaining scientific data
BRE's primary problem was that the sensors for measuring the thermal radiation often
saturated. Although the measurements were not required to meet experiment
success, they were considered sufficiently critical that BRE was equipped with its own
radiometer array, featuring three thermopile detectors. Estimates had been made of
the signal levels based on 5-second drop tests since the hot gases tend to blanket the
flame in the absence of buoyancy and thereby remain within the view of the
radiometers. As a result, the signal levels are strongly dependent on gravity. The
estimates were not part of the science requirements and may not have been
sufficiently tracked in the hardware development. Furthermore, the ISS tests lasted
as long as 5 minutes, which is over four times the envisioned BRE test duration and 60
times the duration of the drop tests. With the fixed amplification of the radiometer
signals, the data was frequently lost - other than the knowledge that the limits were
exceeded. An engineering review failed to identify an acceptable solution and BRE
testing continued unchanged.

Ignition was not always successful. As previously discussed, it was discovered on
April 1 (GMT 091) that the hot-wire igniter tip had failed on the preceding test day,
preventing further flame testing until it could be replaced. While such circumstances
are uncommon for ACME operations, BRE tests were sometimes conducted under
conditions, e.g., for igniter activation and deactivation, which led to momentary
flashes without sustained ignition. Given that unplanned crew time is required to
replace failed igniter tips, the BRE ops team limited - to varying degrees - the igniter
voltage and the time that it was energized within the flame. The latter was known
from earlier research in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to degrade the hot-wire

igniter tip and hasten its demise. It is notable that the flashes of flame (across the
burner surface) sometimes continued briefly after the igniter was deactivated and
retracted. In one case on the first day of testing, there was excess fuel and a 'fireball'
was ignited which promptly quenched. Ignition also sometimes failed due to a
software limitation where the fuelFlowIgnitionDeltaMs parameter which specifies the
relative timing of the fuel flow and igniter activation must be evenly divisible by 100
(ms). This limitation wasn't initially understood and the igniter didn't energize as a
result.

The second day of flame testing was delayed to allow for the development of a new
ignition procedure, where concerns arose that the mixture of gas flowing from the
burner wasn't sufficiently well understood, i.e., in terms of concentrations. This
concern had to do with the burner's large internal volume relative to that of the
burners used for the other ACME experiments. To be clear, this issue had to do with
the analysis of results rather than the achievement of ignition. Re-planning was also
necessary early in BRE testing because the test durations were often much longer than
had earlier been envisioned by the investigators. While these factors didn't directly
interfere with the acquisition of test data, they did slow progress.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

While it rarely occurred, BRE tests sometimes automatically aborted (due to the
controlling software script), where that is typically prior to gas flow and the activation
of the igniter. As a result, there is little lost other than the time associated with the
failed test attempt. Such aborts typically occur because of communication issues with
an Image Processing and Storage Unit (IPSU).


ACME's Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) used to control the flow of fuel and nitrogen
have unfortunately not always performed adequately, where the flow rates have not
always been appropriately steady. The resulting effects on the flame behavior are
tentatively assumed to be minor, but this still needs to be assessed.


# C. Completeness/Quality of Data


The number of flames ignited in Increments 58 and 59 significantly exceeds the planned
tests - under the tested conditions (25 mm burner and ethylene as fuel) - which were
specified as required in the ACME Integrated Science Requirements Document (ISRD). A
total of 25 such tests were required, while 62 flames with those conditions were ignited.
As such, more than twice as many flames were ignited as had been planned.


It should be understood that a complete set of image data is not necessarily available for
all tests. Recorded image data is sometimes deleted without downlinking. This is done
because of operational constraints which limit the amount of data that can be managed
per test day. Given the constraint, the decision is sometimes made to sacrifice some
image data (e.g., from the HiBMs camera) to allow additional tests to be conducted. This
is intentionally done to maximize the scientific return of each day of testing within the
project constraints.

Data quality is of course dependent on the experimental hardware. But neglecting that
limitation on data quality, the cameras are sensitive to radiation where pixels gradually
become 'hot' over time. While these bright spots are addressed in image post-processing,
they are a degradation of the image quality.

See discussion in III.D in regard to fouling or degradation of the paint on the BRE burner's
heat flux sensors.


It is possible that the tests are subtly affected by the acceleration environment, but there
is not obvious indication of this and it has thus far not been evaluated with available
measurements from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). In this regard,
note that the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), in which the experiment is conducted, is
equipped with a Passive Rack Isolation System (PaRIS).


Regardless of the shortcomings discussed above, a great wealth of experimental data has
been secured and BRE's first round, completed in Increment 59, is considered to be
successful despite the frequent saturation of the radiometer data discussed in section


1. 

2. Status of Data Analysis (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral student Parham Dehghani) All measured transient raw data (e.g., heat flux sensors, thermocouples, radiometers, mass flow meters and chamber pressure sensor) have been converted to engineering units and plotted using the calibrations provided in ACME's Software Interface Design Description (ACME-DOC-010 Rev. D).


All of the round 1 tests have had the heat flux sensor data reduced using their original
calibrations. As presented below, the data is being processed to address the effect of the
combustion product water and paint degradation.


The primary measurements are used, by two techniques, to obtain the net heat flux from
the flame to the burner surface. In the steady state, this net heat flux divided by the mass
flow rate per unit area of the fuel mixture gives the heat of gasification of the emulated
fuel. The key hypothesis is that the heat of combustion, smoke point, and heat of
gasification of the fuel mixture will represent a real solid fuel (or liquid fuel absorbed in
an inert matrix). Thus, achieved steady burning would represent the potential for real
solid fuels to achieve steady burning in microgravity. Other than for a candle flame, this
has not been shown before.


The first technique uses two thermopile heat flux gages embedded in the burner surface.
One gage is at the center the other is offset from the center. The resulting data suffered
from two possible effects. The first effect is the condensation of water vapor. As the
sensors are not cooled, but rise with temperature as the flame grows, water from its
combustion products can condense and then evaporate from the sensor. This occurs, as
the dew point for combustion products is about 60-70oC, and the sensor begins at
ambient temperature and can achieve temperatures over 100oC. Thus, condensation can
occur at temperatures below the dew point that leads to added heat to the sensor. Above
the dew point, the condensed water will evaporate and reduce the heat to the sensor.


67




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


When the sensor is dry and above 100oC, it will only measure the heat flux from the flame
gases as intended.


We have duplicated this condensation effect in 1-g laboratory experiments with our
duplicative NASA BRE burner. Fig. 1 illustrates the condensation and evaporation effect
in the ISS tests. The offset sensor in red shows a clear jump increase when the water
fully evaporates. More analysis is needed to properly correct for this effect. Fortunately,
by the end of the test shown here (and for all of the other data), this water effect is gone.


Figure 1. Typical net heat flux of the heat flux sensors.


The second effect on the heat flux sensors is that the heat may have fouled their paint.
This could then affect their calibration. Figure 2 shows an image of the ISS burner after
round 1 tests were concluded. It can be seen that the paint on the sensors is degraded.
This was the original manufacturer's paint, instead of that used for the copper top. The
copper paint appears fine. We are working with the heat flux gage manufacturer to
explore the effect of heat damage on the calibration of the sensors. This will give us a
way to determine a quantitative change in the calibration.

Figure 2. Paint degradation on heat flux sensors.
The second technique to determine the heat flux is the copper calorimeter forming the
top of the burner. The temperature rise of the copper is key to that determination.
Figure 3 shows that typically the copper temperature is nearly uniform and smooth in
time. It does not appear that condensation or evaporation is having any effect on its
temperature behavior. So, we believe we are justified in using this measurement to
predict the overall average heat flux from the flame to the burner. However, we do need
to evaluate any possible effect of the combustion product water. In addition, these
calorimeter data are not fully processed yet because we are refining our methodology for
its calibration. If the heat flux data cannot be completely used with good accuracy, we
have the calorimeter to fall back on.

The calorimeter required a new calibration to account for heat being absorbed through
the bevel edge of copper plate. So, control surfaces are now adjusted (i.e., the edge and
burner back surface area, Aback) and then optimized for new set of calibration constants
which are specific to the burner used in ISS experiments (i.e., mcCu, hback, hrod, and e0). The
calorimeter represents the average heat flux to the surface and is being used to obtain
heats of gasification. Figure 4 shows the transient plots of test 19066D5. The test
conditions for the plots used in this report are presented in Table 2.

Preliminary analysis of the radiometer sensor data has indicated its consistent ability to
measure the flame overall radiation heat loss fraction. The method to determine the
radiative heat flux component to the burner is more complex, and it will rely on
theoretical modeling. This will take some time.


The video images of all the flames have been compiled and are being quantified in terms
of flame shapes.


Alexander Snegirev, our Russian partner, has attempted a numerical simulation of at least
one of the ISS BRE tests. That work is still in progress. It should be remarked his student
won the Student Prize for Best Presentation at the 9th International Seminar on Fire and
Explosion Hazards held in St. Petersburg, Russia in April 2019 for simulating our 5-s BRE
drop tests.


E. Preliminary Research Findings (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral
student Parham Dehghani)
Despite having much data to digest and analyze, there is a profound conclusion from
these tests. The burner has definitively shown that steady burning is possible for real
solids with a flat surface of 25 mm diameter. Up to now most flammability studies in
microgravity have focused on flame spread with a wind for concurrent spread and at least
a self-induced wind for opposed flow spread. We already knew that this would be
possible from normal-gravity research. The burning of liquids, as in a wick of a candle
flame and small droplets, has been shown to produce steady flames. However, many
droplet flames were found to extinguish owing to radiative cooling of the flame. We see
this as well in the extended ISS microgravity tests. However, this extinction was
predominately seen for atmospheric conditions of 21% oxygen and 14.7 psia. At
conditions of 27% oxygen, 10.2 psia and 34% oxygen, 8.2 psia, the flames generally
persisted for 2 minutes or more. These are all atmospheric conditions that NASA is
considering for future spacecraft. Some examples are shown below to illustrate these
results.


Figure 5 shows a typical test of ignition and flame growth. Although extinction occurred
at 45 s with the flame still growing, the heat flux was nearly steady by 30 s. Therefore, a
heat of gasification (L) could be estimated. This was done in a preliminary estimation by
using the center heat flux sensor as the net average heat flux. If the heating is just due to
diffusion, theory indicates that the average heat flux is double the center value. Hence
such an estimated heat of gasification could be low by 50%. On the other hand, if the
sensor is degraded in its calibration and radiation is a significant component of the heat
flux, then the estimate will also be low. Hence, using the center heat flux sensor directly
gives a conservatively low estimate of the heat of gasification in the emulation of real
solids. This will be significant when the totality of results for the 25 mm flat burning
surface is displayed over its spectrum of conservatively low values for L.

In Figure 8 the flame reaches a steady state in about 80 seconds as seen by the flame
shape and the heat flux data. This emulation corresponds to a material with a heat of
combustion of about 22 kJ/g and a heat of gasification of about 3 kJ/g. As such it could
represent PMMA as a material solid. This is a profound result indicating a common plastic
could steadily burn under these NASA proposed atmospheric conditions. Let us examine
another case.

Figure 9 shows steady results for a NASA proposed atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 0.56

estimated as 2.42 kJ/g.

Let us take a preliminary view of all the tests at atmospheres ranging from 21% oxygen
and 1 to 0.56 atm with fuel mixtures of about 22 and 44 kJ/g heats of combustion. With
only discriminating by oxygen concentrations, Figure 10 shows a dramatic result. The fuel
mixture mass flux is plotted against the estimated value of the center heat flux reading at
the end of the test, as it appeared steady. As seen in the figure, all of the flames at 21 %
oxygen led to self-extinction in less than about 25 s, most of the flames at 27 % oxygen
and all of the flames at 34% oxygen reached steady burning. As stated earlier, the

however, the range of L values displayed in Figure 10 and 14(a). clearly show that it
includes nearly all combustible solid and liquid materials. This result has a profound
implication for fire safety in spaceflight and planetary human missions.

Radiative loss fraction from the flames are obtained using the radiometer's
measurements. Unfortunately, the data set is limited as the BRE sensors were saturated
for several tests. The +60 mm and the offset radiometers were used to obtain the
radiative loss fraction as these two sensors provided data in multiple cases while the other
two radiometers were saturated. The transient radiative loss fraction for 19066D5 and
19070L1 are shown in Figure 11. Radiative loss fractions obtained from both radiometers
show good agreement for all studied cases and it is shown for 2 steady tests in Figure 11.

Two methods are proposed to obtain radiative heat flux on the burner surface. The first
method is called 'Mean Beam Length' method and it is assumed that the radiative gasses
are distributed homogeneously throughout the flame envelope. The second method is
called the 'View Factor' method and it assumes that the flame is a thin sheet where all
the radiation is generated at this sheet. Radiation view factor of the surface of the burner
with respect to the flame sheet is then calculated which leads to obtaining the radiative
heat flux on the burner surface. Figure 13 shows the radiative heat flux on the burner
surface obtained by mentioned methods.

# I. Introduction


The Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment is conducted in the Combustion Integrated Rack
(CIR) on the International Space Station, as part of the Advanced Combustion via Microgravity
Experiments (ACME) project. BRE is focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically,
BRE's goals are to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability, such as
extinction behavior and the conditions needed for sustained combustion, and to assess the
relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. A flat
porous burner fed with gaseous fuel simulates the burning of solid and liquid fuels, where
measurements are made of the thermal feedback (i.e., to the burner) upon which the
vaporization of condensed-phase fuels is dependent. A small number of gaseous fuels (including
mixtures with inert gases) are used to simulate the burning of fuels such as paper, plastic, and
alcohol by matching properties including the heats of combustion and gasification, the surface

temperature, and smoke point. The experiment's results can establish fuel properties that
directly relate to fire hazards in spacecraft, and if effective in microgravity could provide an
efficient, safe, and comprehensive technique for assessing flammability and selecting fire-
resistant spacecraft materials.


BRE's specific experimental objectives are as follows, where it must be emphasized that NASA
does not currently plan to carry out the desired tests for objective B.


1. Observe burning behavior in long-duration microgravity for CH4/N2 and C2H4/N2 mixtures on porous circular burners of 25 and 50 mm diameter. Consider O2/N2 ambients with various pressures and ambient O2 concentrations and pressures. NASA-considered atmosphere for human space missions will be examined: 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen; 10.2 psia, 26.5 %; and 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. Emphasize fuel conditions that can be related to a diverse range of condensed fuels.

2. Consider the conditions of Objective 1 for ambients of O2/CO2 (desired).


I. Consider the conditions of Objectives 1 - 2 for extinction limits.


The observations will enable quantification of the microgravity behavior of condensed fuels (i.e.,
liquids and non-charring plastics).


Microgravity studies of flames allow for a range of simplifications and provide various advantages
over normal-gravity studies. For example, the flicker of flame, which is a buoyancy-driven (i.e.,
gravity-driven) instability, is eliminated yielding quasi-steady flames in microgravity. Length
scales are increased in microgravity flames facilitating analysis of the flame structure.
Momentum-dominated flames, which are important for most practical combustion, can be
studied at low velocities to simplify analysis. Microgravity flames tend to have a much stronger
sensitivity to their atmosphere and exhibit a much broader range of characteristics than normal-
gravity flames because of the near absence of buoyant entrainment. The long residence times in
microgravity flames can lead to strong soot production, but many microgravity flames are soot
free. The absence of buoyancy makes microgravity flames advantageous for studies of limit and
stability behavior where chemical kinetics are important. With these advantages, microgravity
testing can lead to new understanding of the complex nature of combustion - regardless of the
gravitational environment of the combustion application.


# II. Methods/Research Operations


# A. Discussion of Method/Protocol


BRE and other ACME experiments are configured, but not conducted, by the ISS crew.
The crew's role is to set up the hardware, gas bottles, etc. for each set of tests. The most
common changes include the gas bottles on the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) and
the mass flow controllers on the modular ACME chamber insert.


All testing is commanded from the ground, specifically from the operations center at the
NASA Glenn Research Center. The science portion of the testing is typically conducted in


80

a nominally automated mode using pre-programmed scripts. However, it could
alternately be conducted in a 'manual' mode, where changes are made to a control
parameter in response to the analog video downlink and the numerical data available in
the telemetry stream. For example, gas flow rate(s) can be adjusted after quasi-steady
data has been collected. But testing has not been conducted in a 'manual' mode thus far
for BRE or ACME in general.


Testing is not conducted when thrusters fire or spacecraft dock or undock from ISS to
ensure an acceptable acceleration environment.


Data is downlinked between each set of tests, i.e., day of testing, to allow for preliminary
analysis and requisite planning for subsequent testing.


# III. Results A. Baselined Activities Completed - Pre-flight, In-flight, Post-Flight


The first round of BRE tests began in February 2019, during Increment 58, when a total of
45 flames were ignited. That round was completed in April 2019, during Increment 59,
when an additional 17 flames were ignited. As such, a total of 62 flames were ignited in
the first round of testing. Meanwhile, the BRE's second-round flame testing began in
Sept. 2020, during Increment 63, during which 47 flames were ignited. The second and
final round of tests should be completed during Increment 64.


The 'interruption' in the BRE testing was intentionally planned years in advance to enable
the PI team to review the initial results in detail and with that knowledge plan the second
round of tests to maximize its scientific outcome. However, the break was longer than
had been planned because of combination of hardware issues and limited crew
availability. As a result, BRE's second round was rescheduled to occur after both rounds
of the preceding ACME experiment, Structure and Response of Spherical Diffusion Flames


(s-Flame), was completed, where that occurred in July 2020. A factor in that decision was


the delayed start of commercial crew launches and understanding that crew availability
would be limited until such crew launches entered an operational, rather than
demonstration, phase.


All first-round tests were conducted with the 25-mm diameter BRE burner while burning
ethylene (C2H4) - sometimes diluted with nitrogen. The tests were carried out at a range
of chamber pressures and oxygen concentrations, generally representative of possible
crew environments in future spacecraft or habitats. More specifically, testing was
especially focused on atmospheric conditions at (1) 14.7 psia, 21% oxygen; (2) 10.2 psia,


26.5% oxygen; and (3) 8.2 psia, 34% oxygen. In all cases, the atmosphere was diluted with


nitrogen and any incomplete combustion products (e.g., water vapor and carbon dioxide)
from preceding tests. An exception is tests conducted after the chamber atmosphere was


81




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

vented and refilled, such as the first test of the day. But during tests days, the atmosphere
was typically refreshed once or twice between sets of tests.


Second round testing is being carried out including both BRE burner diameters, i.e., 25
and 50 mm, and on some days with methane (CH4) - again sometimes diluted with
nitrogen. Therefore, the second round of tests features a broader range of conditions
than investigated during the first round.


BRE does not have living subjects like a life science experiment. The tests are
independently conducted with two different gaseous fuels, methane and ethylene. Both
are simple hydrocarbon gases for which the chemistry is well understood. Methane (CH4)
is the primary component of natural gas and tends to produce low levels of soot given the
absence of carbon-carbon bonds. Meanwhile, ethylene (C2H4), is normally highly sooting
because of its carbon double bond. Tests are conducted with pure fuel and fuel mixed
with nitrogen, where the fuel and nitrogen were premixed on the ground prior to launch
for some cases. But the ACME hardware also allows for simultaneous flow of fuel and
nitrogen to the burner, allowing for on-orbit fuel dilution and testing at a continuum of
fuel concentrations.


There are no samples (e.g., of soot) collected for BRE, where all ISS results are
electronically transmitted to the ground. That is furthermore the case for all currently
planned ACME experiments.


A summary log of the flames ignited for BRE during Increments 58 and 59 (the first round
of tests) and Increment 63 (the start of second round) is found in Table 1. The table
includes a limited overview of the test conditions. For completeness, a row was included
for testing on April 1 (GMT 091) even though it was quickly discovered that the hot-wire
igniter tip had failed at the end of the preceding test day. As a result, flames were not
ignited until a few days later after astronaut Nick Hague had replaced the igniter tip.

# B. List of Preflight, In-flight, Postflight Anomalies


# 1. Mission anomalies


There were no significant anomalies hindering BRE operations during Increments 59
and 63, but there was one in Increment 58 during the preparations for BRE testing
(that was mistakenly not addressed in the 30-day report including that increment). It
was discovered on Feb. 4 (GMT 035) that the pressure was low in a check gas bottle
for the CIR's Gas Chromatograph Instrumentation Package (GCIP). The bottle had
been on the space station for 9 years, and the low pressure was attributed to a
nominal leak rate. The check gas was for calibration of the GCIP measurements and
not needed for regular operations which proceeded unhindered. The bottle was
replaced on June 13 to enable the necessary calibration.

2. Any other difficulties in obtaining scientific data
BRE's primary problem was that the sensors for measuring the thermal radiation often
saturated. Although the measurements were not required to meet experiment
success, they were considered sufficiently critical that BRE was equipped with its own
radiometer array, featuring three thermopile detectors. Estimates had been made of
the signal levels based on 5-second drop tests since the hot gases tend to blanket the
flame in the absence of buoyancy and thereby remain within the view of the
radiometers. As a result, the signal levels are strongly dependent on gravity. The
estimates were not part of the science requirements and may not have been
sufficiently tracked in the hardware development. Furthermore, the ISS tests lasted
as long as 5 minutes, which is over four times the envisioned BRE test duration and 60
times the duration of the drop tests. With the fixed amplification of the radiometer
signals, the data was frequently lost - other than the knowledge that the limits were
exceeded. An engineering review failed to identify an acceptable solution and BRE
testing continued unchanged.

Ignition was not always successful. As previously discussed, it was discovered on 1
April 2019 (GMT 091) that the hot-wire igniter tip had failed on the preceding test
day, preventing further flame testing until it could be replaced. While such
circumstances are uncommon for ACME operations, BRE tests were sometimes
conducted under conditions, e.g., for igniter activation and deactivation, which led to
momentary flashes without sustained ignition. Given that unplanned crew time is
required to replace failed igniter tips, the BRE ops team limited - to varying degrees -
the igniter voltage and the time that it was energized within the flame. The latter was
known from earlier research in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to degrade the
hot-wire igniter tip and hasten its demise. It is notable that the flashes of flame
(across the burner surface) sometimes continued briefly after the igniter was
deactivated and retracted. In one case on the first day of testing, there was excess
fuel and a 'fireball' was ignited which promptly quenched. Ignition also sometimes
failed due to a software limitation where the fuelFlowIgnitionDeltaMs parameter
which specifies the relative timing of the fuel flow and igniter activation must be
evenly divisible by 100 (ms). This limitation wasn't initially understood and the igniter
didn't energize as a result.

The second day of round-1 flame testing was delayed to allow for the development of
a new ignition procedure, where concerns arose that the mixture of gas flowing from
the burner wasn't sufficiently well understood, i.e., in terms of concentrations. This
concern had to do with the burner's large internal volume relative to that of the
burners used for the other ACME experiments. To be clear, this issue had to do with
the analysis of results rather than the achievement of ignition. Re-planning was also
necessary early in BRE testing because the test durations were often much longer than
had earlier been envisioned by the investigators. While these factors didn't directly
interfere with the acquisition of test data, they did slow progress.


While it rarely occurred, BRE tests sometimes automatically aborted (due to the
controlling software script), where that is typically prior to gas flow and the activation
of the igniter. As a result, there is little lost other than the time associated with the
failed test attempt. Such aborts typically occur because of communication issues with
an Image Processing and Storage Unit (IPSU).


ACME's Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) used to control the flow of fuel and nitrogen
have unfortunately not always performed adequately, where the flow rates have not


85




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

always been appropriately steady. The resulting effects on the flame behavior are
tentatively assumed to be minor, but this still needs to be assessed.


While it didn't prevent the acquisition of scientific data, the intended igniter arm,
which establishes the relative positioning of the igniter tip and burner, was not found
for the round-2 hardware set-up. Therefore, an alternate arm, which positioned the
igniter further from the burner than intended, was used for the 3 Sept. 2020 testing.
Fortunately, the flames were still reliably ignited and the proper igniter arm was found
and installed prior to the subsequent test day.


However, it was determined that the 3 Sept. 2020 science objectives were not
accomplished because the fuel didn't always transition to the intended test flow rate.
As a result of concerns about the ignition success because of the use of the alternate
igniter arm, the decision was made to repeatedly ignite the flame at the same fuel
flow rate and then subsequently adjust it to the desired test flow rate. The first
attempt was successful, but the transition time was shortened to save fuel, etc. which
unfortunately prevented the flow transition. In other words, the transition time was
too short where that wasn't discovered until review of the data days later. As a result,
the tests were generally conducted at the same fuel flow rate, where that was meant
to be a variable. As a result, the data currently doesn't allow a full assessment of the
effect of the burner size on the flammability. Therefore, a make-up test day in
Increment 64 has been planned to address this shortcoming.


# C. Completeness/Quality of Data


The number of flames ignited in Increments 58 and 59 significantly exceeds the planned
tests - under the tested conditions (25 mm burner and ethylene as fuel) - which were
specified as required in the ACME Integrated Science Requirements Document (ISRD). A
total of 25 such tests were required, while 62 flames with those conditions were ignited.
As such, more than twice as many flames were ignited as had been planned.


An additional 48 tests were specified as required in the ISRD to fully accomplish the BRE
science objectives, i.e., where a total of 73 test points were required. While there were
issues with the Increment 63 testing, e.g., discussed in section B, 47 flames were ignited
in Sept.-Oct. 2020, where 6 additional test days are currently planned for Increment 64
(including the make-up day previously discussed). As such, it is expected that far more
tests will be conducted than had been originally planned for BRE's second round.


It should be understood that a complete set of image data is not necessarily available for
all tests. Recorded image data is sometimes deleted without downlinking. This is done
because of operational constraints which limit the amount of data that can be managed
per test day. Given the constraint, the decision is sometimes made to sacrifice some
image data (e.g., from the HiBMs camera) to allow additional tests to be conducted. This
is intentionally done to maximize the scientific return of each day of testing within the
project constraints.

Data quality is of course dependent on the experimental hardware. But neglecting that
limitation on data quality, the cameras are sensitive to radiation where pixels gradually
become 'hot' over time. While these bright spots are addressed in image post-processing,
they are a degradation of the image quality.


See the discussion in III.D regarding fouling or degradation of the paint on the BRE
burner's heat flux sensors.


It is possible that the tests are subtly affected by the acceleration environment, but there
is not obvious indication of this and it has thus far not been evaluated with available
measurements from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). Note that
although the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), in which the experiment is conducted, is
equipped with a Passive Rack Isolation System (PaRIS) it was not utilized for BRE (or any
ACME) testing because of the crew time needed to enable and disable the isolation before
and after testing.


Regardless of the shortcomings discussed above, a great wealth of experimental data has
been secured and BRE's first round is considered to be successful despite the frequent
saturation of the radiometer data discussed in section III.B.2.


D. Status of Data Analysis (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral student
Parham Dehghani)
All measured transient raw data (e.g., heat flux sensors, thermocouples, radiometers,
mass flow meters and chamber pressure sensor) have been converted to engineering
units and plotted using the calibrations provided in ACME's Software Interface Design
Description (ACME-DOC-010 Rev. D).


All of the round 1 tests have had the heat flux sensor data reduced using their original
calibrations. As presented below, the data is being processed to address the effect of the
combustion product water condensation on the sensor surfaces.


87




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

primary measurements are used, by two techniques, to obtain the net heat flux from


The


the flame to the burner surface. In the steady state, this net heat flux divided by the mass
flow rate per unit area of the fuel mixture gives the heat of gasification of the emulated
fuel. The key hypothesis is that the heat of combustion, smoke point, and heat of
gasification of the fuel mixture will represent a real solid fuel (or liquid fuel absorbed in
an inert matrix). Thus, achieved steady burning would represent the potential for real
solid fuels to achieve steady burning in microgravity. Other than for a candle flame, this
has not been shown before.


The first technique uses two thermopile heat flux gages embedded in the burner surface.
One gage is at the center the other is offset from the center (r = 9.5 mm). As the sensors
are not cooled, but rise with temperature as the flame grows, water from its combustion
products can condense and then evaporate from the sensor. This occurs, as the dew point
for combustion products is about 60-70oC, and the sensor begins at ambient temperature
and can achieve temperatures over 100oC. Thus, condensation can occur at
temperatures below the dew point that leads to added heat to the sensor. Above the
dew point, the condensed water will evaporate and reduce the heat to the sensor. When
the sensor is dry and above 100oC, it will only measure the heat flux from the flame gases
as intended.


We have duplicated this condensation effect in 1-g laboratory experiments with the
duplicative NASA BRE burner. Fig. 1 illustrates the condensation and evaporation effect
in the ISS tests. The offset sensor in red shows a clear jump increase when the water fully
evaporates. More analysis is needed to properly correct for this effect. Fortunately, by
the end of the test shown here (and for all of the other data), this water effect is gone.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

The second effect on the heat flux sensors is that the heat may have fouled their paint.
This could then affect their calibration. Figure 2 shows an image of the ISS burner after
round 1 tests were concluded. It can be seen that the paint on the sensors is degraded.
This was the original manufacturer's paint, instead of that used for the copper top. The
copper paint appears fine. We worked with the heat flux gage manufacturer to explore
the effect of heat damage on the calibration of the sensors. The results showed that the
calibration was stable and didn't change during the process of heating and cooling.

sensors.


second technique to determine the heat flux is the copper calorimeter forming the


The


top of the burner. The temperature rise of the copper is key to that determination.
Figure 3 shows that typically the copper temperature is nearly uniform and smooth in
time. It does not appear that condensation or evaporation is having any effect on its
temperature behavior. So, we believe we are justified in using this measurement to
predict the overall average heat flux from the flame to the burner.

The calorimeter required a new calibration to account for heat being absorbed through
the bevel edge of copper plate. So, control surfaces are now adjusted (i.e., the edge and
burner back surface area, Aback) and then optimized for new set of calibration constants
which are specific to the burner used in ISS tests (i.e., mcCu, hback, hrod, and e0). The
calorimeter represents the average heat flux to the surface and is being used to obtain
heats of gasification. Figure 4 shows the transient plots of test 19066D5. The test
conditions for the plots used in this report are presented in Table 2. We found out that
there is significant heat absorption by the bevel edge of the burner that induces error to
the calorimeter heat flux. A theoretical analysis was implied to estimate the radiative,
convective and re-radiation heat flux to and from the top surface and the bevel edge of
the burner which helped in estimation of the error induced to the calorimeter data.

Our analysis of the radiometer sensor data has indicated its consistent ability to measure
the flame overall radiation heat loss fraction. The method to determine the radiative heat
flux component to the burner is more complex, and it is based on the geometrical details
of the radiometers and burner surface relative distance and orientation. Also, the burner
surface will re-radiate heat that impinges the radiometer and it needs to be corrected. All
of the available radiation data are processed for the first round of testing and an empirical
radiation correlation with flame height is found.


The video images of all the flames have been compiled and are being quantified in terms
of flame shapes. Also, a summary booklet of all of the key findings along with heat flux
and surface temperature data for each test was compiled.


Alexander Snegirev, our Russian partner, has attempted a numerical simulation of at least
one of the ISS BRE tests. That work is still in progress. It should be remarked his student
won the Student Prize for Best Presentation at the 9th International Seminar on Fire and
Explosion Hazards held in St. Petersburg, Russia in April 2019 for simulating our 5-s BRE
drop tests.


E. Preliminary Research Findings (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral
student Parham Dehghani)
The burner has shown that quasi-steady burning is possible for real solids with a flat
surface of 25 mm diameter. Up to now most flammability studies in microgravity have
focused on flame spread with a wind for concurrent spread and at least a self-induced
wind for opposed flow spread. We already knew that this would be possible from normal-
gravity research. The burning of liquids, as in a wick of a candle flame and small droplets,
has been shown to produce steady flames. However, many droplet flames were found to
extinguish owing to radiative cooling of the flame. We see this as well in the extended
ISS microgravity tests. However, this extinction was predominately seen for nominal
ambient conditions of 21% oxygen and 14.7 psia. At conditions of 27% oxygen, 10.2 psia
and 34% oxygen, 8.2 psia, the flames generally persisted for 3 minutes or more. These are
all atmospheric conditions that NASA is considering for future spacecraft


Figure 5 shows a typical test of ignition and flame growth. Although extinction occurred
at 45 s with the flame still growing, the heat flux was nearly steady by 30 s. Therefore, a
heat of gasification (L) could be estimated. This was done by using the arithmetic average
of the center and offset heat flux sensor as the net average heat flux.

Figures 6 through 9 illustrate results for nominal atmospheric conditions of 26.5% oxygen
and 0.7 atm (10.2 psia), and 34% oxygen and 0.56 atm (8.2 psia), respectively with two
figures each. Both use 50% mixtures of nitrogen and ethylene giving a fuel mixture heat
of combustion of 24 kJ/g. Both of these tests reached quasi-steady conditions and were
terminated by shutting off the fuel. The plots of transient heat flux shown by Figures 7
and 9, show the condensation effect removed after 80 s and 40 s respectively and
arithmetic average of the two heat flux gauge measurements at the end of each test is
recorded as steady surface heat flux which are used to obtain heats of gasification.

In Figures 8 and 9 the flame reaches a quasi-steady state in about 80 seconds as seen by
the flame shape and the heat flux data. This emulation corresponds to a material with a
heat of combustion of about 24 kJ/g and a heat of gasification of about 3 kJ/g. As such it
could represent PMMA as a material solid. This is a profound result indicating a common
plastic could steadily burn under these NASA proposed atmospheric conditions.

Figure 9 shows steady results for a NASA proposed nominal atmosphere of 34% oxygen

here is estimated as 2.42 kJ/g.

Radiative loss fraction from the flames are obtained using the radiometer's
measurements. Unfortunately, the data set is limited as the BRE sensors were saturated
for several tests. The +60 mm and the offset radiometers were used to obtain the
radiative loss fraction as these two sensors provided data in multiple cases while the other
two radiometers were saturated. The transient radiative loss fraction for 19066D5 and
19070L1 are shown in Figure 10 for both radiometers, which show good agreement with
each other. Table 2 provides information about the test conditions.

Flame heights at the end of the tests are measured from the image data. The radiative
loss fraction is correlated with flame height and fuel mixture mass flux. The results from
first round tests are shown in Figure 11.

end-point results.


A simple analysis based on geometrical view factor of surface with respect to the flame
sheet, allowed us to estimate the fraction of the total available heat that impinges
surface. Also, the analytical model (the Ellipsoidal model) based on classical diffusion
theory was used to estimate the convective heat flux to the surface which are shown by
Figures 12 and 13, respectively. Adding up the convective, radiative and re-radiation from
surface results in total average heat flux that gives theoretical heats of gasification when
divided by fuel mixture mass flux.

The experimental flammability maps are shown in Figures 14 and 15. Both plots indicate
a decreasing, inverse asymptotic-like curve that approaches zero, for heat of gasification
with mass flux. It is surprising that the data cluster about a nearly singular trend.
However, both plots show the heat of gasification is up to 20 % higher for the lower heat
of combustion 23.6 kJ/g. Our experiments in University of Maryland lab has shown, with
the BRE in 1-g, that similar results for propane-nitrogen mixtures have the opposite
behavior with heats of gasification decreasing with heat of combustion for the same mass
flux. But again, the data mostly cluster about one trend line except for very low heats of
combustion. However, the 1-g corresponding heat of combustion data shift far to the
right and down from the microgravity data of Figures 14 and 15. For example, the 1-g
data would indicate ( 𝑚̇",𝐿) points of about 30 g/m2s, 2 kJ/g and 10, 0.5. Moreover, our
previous work in a 5- s drop facility suggested similar data trends but with an apparent
vertical asymptote at about 3 g/m2s, rather than 1 as shown here. Obviously, the current
data at durations of minutes are more accurate than those limited to 5 s. However, it has
been shown that the ISS heat flux data even at self-extinction are theoretically nearly
steady. Figures 14 and 15 include the heats of gasification derived from the self-

extinguished endpoint data as well. Remarkably, the self-extinguished not-so-steady data
follow the same trend as the steady data.


Let us interpret Figures 14 and 15 in terms of the flammability of real materials in
microgravity. Typical melting plastics have heats of gasification ranging from about 2 to
3 kJ/g, with effective heats of gasification for charring plastics above 4 kJ/g. Some
selected literature values for materials with heats of combustion in the BRE range are
listed in Table 3. The accuracy of the calorimeter heat flux is found to be less than the
two sensors, thus, we relied on the arithmetic average of the two heat flux sensors data
for obtaining the flammability map. However, same results are shown considering the
calorimeter data. Figure 14. would suggest that polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP)
would burn in microgravity at about 3 g/m2s. Nylon and PMMA would burn at about 2.5
g/m2s, and the phenolic glass fiber composite would burn at about 1 g/m2s.

sequences for all of the tests taken so far. Preliminary analysis on the first three days of
the second round of ISS testing data are performed. Many of the first day tests with the


50-mm BRE burner were not at the intended flow rate. A make-up day will be carried out


to accomplish the day's scientific objectives. The second day plan contained a
combination of pure and diluted ethylene at 3 different ambient conditions. Pure
methane was the fuel used for testing on the third day at 3 different nominal ambient
conditions. It was observed that methane was hard to ignite compared to ethylene and
flames tend to self-extinguish faster even at a high oxygen concentration.


A new method is used to observe the asymptotic behavior of the heat flux data. The
inverse of the burn-time was used as the abscissa and the transient data from the two
heat flux sensors are shown in Figure 17 for one of the tests.

# I. Introduction


The Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment is conducted in the Combustion Integrated Rack
(CIR) on the International Space Station, as part of the Advanced Combustion via Microgravity
Experiments (ACME) project. BRE is focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically,
BRE's goals are to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability, such as
extinction behavior and the conditions needed for sustained combustion, and to assess the
relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. A flat
porous burner fed with gaseous fuel simulates the burning of solid and liquid fuels, where
measurements are made of the thermal feedback (i.e., to the burner) upon which the
vaporization of condensed-phase fuels is dependent. A small number of gaseous fuels (including
mixtures with inert gases) are used to simulate the burning of fuels such as paper, plastic, and

alcohol by matching properties including the heats of combustion and gasification, the surface
temperature, and smoke point. The experiment's results can establish fuel properties that
directly relate to fire hazards in spacecraft, and if effective in microgravity could provide an
efficient, safe, and comprehensive technique for assessing flammability and selecting fire-
resistant spacecraft materials.


BRE's specific experimental objectives are as follows, where it must be emphasized that NASA
does not currently plan to carry out the desired tests for objective B.


1. Observe burning behavior in long-duration microgravity for CH4/N2 and C2H4/N2 mixtures on porous circular burners of 25 and 50 mm diameter. Consider O2/N2 ambients with various pressures and ambient O2 concentrations and pressures. NASA- considered atmosphere for human space missions will be examined: 14.7 psia, 21 % oxygen; 10.2 psia, 26.5 %; and 8.2 psia, 34 % oxygen. Emphasize fuel conditions that can be related to a diverse range of condensed fuels.

2. Consider the conditions of Objective 1 for ambients of O2/CO2 (desired).

3. Consider the conditions of Objectives 1 - 2 for extinction limits.


The observations will enable quantification of the microgravity behavior of condensed fuels (i.e.,
liquids and non-charring plastics).


Microgravity studies of flames allow for a range of simplifications and provide various advantages
over normal-gravity studies. For example, the flicker of flame, which is a buoyancy-driven (i.e.,
gravity-driven) instability, is eliminated yielding quasi-steady flames in microgravity. Length
scales are increased in microgravity flames facilitating analysis of the flame structure.
Momentum-dominated flames, which are important for most practical combustion, can be
studied at low velocities to simplify analysis. Microgravity flames tend to have a much stronger
sensitivity to their atmosphere and exhibit a much broader range of characteristics than normal-
gravity flames because of the near absence of buoyant entrainment. The long residence times in
microgravity flames can lead to strong soot production, but many microgravity flames are soot
free. The absence of buoyancy makes microgravity flames advantageous for studies of limit and
stability behavior where chemical kinetics are important. With these advantages, microgravity
testing can lead to new understanding of the complex nature of combustion - regardless of the
gravitational environment of the combustion application.


# II. Methods/Research Operations


# A. Discussion of Method/Protocol


BRE and other ACME experiments are configured, but not conducted, by the ISS crew.
The crew's role is to set up the hardware, gas bottles, etc. for each set of tests. The most
common changes include the gas bottles on the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) and
the mass flow controllers on the modular ACME chamber insert.

All testing is commanded from the ground, specifically from the operations center at the
NASA Glenn Research Center. The science portion of the testing is typically conducted in
a nominally automated mode using pre-programmed scripts. However, it could
alternately be conducted in a 'manual' mode, where changes are made to a control
parameter in response to the analog video downlink and the numerical data available in
the telemetry stream. For example, gas flow rate(s) can be adjusted after quasi-steady
data has been collected. But testing has not been conducted in a 'manual' mode thus far
for BRE or ACME in general.


Testing is not conducted when thrusters fire or spacecraft dock or undock from ISS to
ensure an acceptable acceleration environment.


Data is downlinked between each set of tests, i.e., day of testing, to allow for preliminary
analysis and requisite planning for subsequent testing.


# III. Results A. Baselined Activities Completed - Pre-flight, In-flight, Post-Flight


The first round of BRE tests began in February 2019, during Increment 58, when a total of
45 flames were ignited. That round was completed in April 2019, during Increment 59,
when an additional 17 flames were ignited. BRE's second-round flame testing began in
Sept. 2020, during Increment 63, in which 47 flames were ignited. The second and final
round of tests was completed in Jan. 2021, during Increment 64, when another 85 flames
were ignited. As a result, 62 and 132 flames were respectively ignited in the first and
second rounds of testing for a total of 194 flames.


The 'interruption' in the BRE testing was intentionally planned years in advance to enable
the PI team to review the initial results in detail and with that knowledge plan the second
round of tests to maximize its scientific outcome. However, the break was longer than
had been planned because of combination of hardware issues and limited crew
availability. As a result, BRE's second round was rescheduled to occur after both rounds
of the preceding ACME experiment, Structure and Response of Spherical Diffusion Flames


(s-Flame), was completed, where that occurred in July 2020. A factor in that decision was


the delayed start of commercial crew launches and understanding that crew availability
would be limited until such crew launches entered an operational, rather than
demonstration, phase.


All first-round tests were conducted with the 25-mm diameter BRE burner while burning
ethylene (C2H4) - sometimes diluted with nitrogen. The tests were carried out at a range
of chamber pressures and oxygen concentrations, generally representative of possible
crew environments in future spacecraft or habitats. More specifically, testing was
especially focused on atmospheric conditions at (1) 14.7 psia, 21% oxygen; (2) 10.2 psia,


26.5% oxygen; and (3) 8.2 psia, 34% oxygen. In all cases, the atmosphere was diluted with


110




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

nitrogen and any combustion products (e.g., water vapor and carbon dioxide) from
preceding tests. An exception is tests conducted after the chamber atmosphere was
vented and refilled, such as the first test of the day. But during tests days, the atmosphere
was typically refreshed once or twice between sets of tests.
Second round testing was carried out including both BRE burner diameters, i.e., 25 and
50 mm, and on some days with methane (CH4) - again sometimes diluted with nitrogen.
Therefore, the second round of tests featured a broader range of conditions than
investigated during the first round. However, in contrast to the first round most of the
round 2 tests were carried out at roughly 14.7 psia, although pressure has a secondary
effect on flames. Meanwhile, the tests in this round were carried out at various oxygen
concentrations as in the first round but were more often conducted with ~40% oxygen,
where oxygen of course has a strong effect on combustion.


BRE does not have living subjects like a life science experiment. The tests are
independently conducted with two different gaseous fuels, methane and ethylene. Both
are simple hydrocarbon gases for which the chemistry is well understood. Methane (CH4)
is the primary component of natural gas and tends to produce low levels of soot given the
absence of carbon-carbon bonds. Meanwhile, ethylene (C2H4), is normally highly sooting
because of its carbon double bond. Tests are conducted with pure fuel and fuel mixed
with nitrogen, where the fuel and nitrogen were premixed on the ground prior to launch
for some cases. But the ACME hardware also allows for simultaneous flow of fuel and
nitrogen to the burner, allowing for on-orbit fuel dilution and testing at a continuum of
fuel concentrations.


There are no samples (e.g., of soot) collected for BRE, where all ISS results are
electronically transmitted to the ground. That is furthermore the case for all currently
planned ACME experiments.


A summary log of the flames ignited for BRE during Increments 58 and 59 (the first round
of tests) and Increment 63 and 64 (the second round) is found in Table 1. The table
includes a limited overview of the test conditions. For completeness, a row was included
for testing on 1 April 2019 (GMT 091) even though it was quickly discovered that the hot-
wire igniter tip had failed at the end of the preceding test day. As a result, flames were
not ignited until a few days later after astronaut Nick Hague had replaced the igniter tip.

# B. List of Preflight, In-flight, Postflight Anomalies


# 1. Mission anomalies


There were no significant anomalies hindering BRE operations during Increments 59
and 63, but there was one in Increment 58 during the preparations for BRE testing
(that was mistakenly not addressed in the 30-day report including that increment). It
was discovered on Feb. 4 (GMT 035) that the pressure was low in a check gas bottle
for the CIR's Gas Chromatograph Instrumentation Package (GCIP). The bottle had


112




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


been on the space station for 9 years, and the low pressure was attributed to a
nominal leak rate. The check gas was for calibration of the GCIP measurements and
not needed for regular operations which proceeded unhindered. The bottle was
replaced on June 13 to enable the necessary calibration.


The anomaly in Increment 64 was similar in that there was a slow leak of the GCIP's
argon carrier gas. As a result, the bottle valves for all of the instrument's gas bottles
were closed on Dec. 29, 2020 (GMT 364) making those measurements unavailable for
the BRE's last three test days.


2. Any other difficulties in obtaining scientific data
BRE's primary problem was that the sensors for measuring the thermal radiation often
saturated. Although the measurements were not required to meet experiment
success, they were considered sufficiently critical that BRE was equipped with its own
radiometer array, featuring three thermopile detectors. Estimates had been made of
the signal levels based on 5-second drop tests since the hot gases tend to blanket the
flame in the absence of buoyancy and thereby remain within the view of the
radiometers. As a result, the signal levels are strongly dependent on gravity. The
estimates were not part of the science requirements and may not have been
sufficiently tracked in the hardware development. Furthermore, the ISS tests lasted
as long as 5 minutes, which is over four times the envisioned BRE test duration and 60
times the duration of the drop tests. With the fixed amplification of the radiometer
signals, the data was frequently lost - other than the knowledge that the limits were
exceeded. An engineering review failed to identify an acceptable solution and BRE
testing continued unchanged during the first round, i.e., during increments 58 and 59.

Saturation of the radiometers was partially mitigated in the round 2 testing, during
increments 63 and 64, through use of ACME's standard array instead of the one
developed specifically for BRE.


Ignition was not always successful. As previously discussed, it was discovered on 1
April 2019 (GMT 091) that the hot-wire igniter tip had failed on the preceding test
day, preventing further flame testing until it could be replaced. While such
circumstances are uncommon for ACME operations, BRE tests were sometimes
conducted under conditions, e.g., for igniter activation and deactivation, which led to
momentary flashes without sustained ignition. Given that unplanned crew time is
required to replace failed igniter tips, the BRE ops team limited - to varying degrees -
the igniter voltage and the time that it was energized within the flame. The latter was

known from earlier research in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to degrade the
hot-wire igniter tip and hasten its demise. It is notable that the flashes of flame
(across the burner surface) sometimes continued briefly after the igniter was
deactivated and retracted. In one case on the first day of testing, there was excess
fuel and a 'fireball' was ignited which promptly quenched. Ignition also sometimes
failed due to a software limitation where the fuelFlowIgnitionDeltaMs parameter
which specifies the relative timing of the fuel flow and igniter activation must be
evenly divisible by 100 (ms). This limitation wasn't initially understood and the igniter
didn't energize as a result.

</table>


The second day of round-1 flame testing was delayed to allow for the development of
a new ignition procedure, where concerns arose that the mixture of gas flowing from
the burner wasn't sufficiently well understood, i.e., in terms of concentrations. This
concern had to do with the burner's large internal volume relative to that of the
burners used for the other ACME experiments. To be clear, this issue had to do with
the analysis of results rather than the achievement of ignition. Re-planning was also
necessary early in BRE testing because the test durations were often much longer than
had earlier been envisioned by the investigators. While these factors didn't directly
interfere with the acquisition of test data, they did slow progress.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

While it rarely occurred, BRE tests sometimes automatically aborted (due to the
controlling software script), where that is typically prior to gas flow and the activation
of the igniter. As a result, there is little lost other than the time associated with the
failed test attempt. Such aborts typically occur because of communication issues with
an Image Processing and Storage Unit (IPSU).


ACME's Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) used to control the flow of fuel and nitrogen
have unfortunately not always performed adequately, where the flow rates have not
always been appropriately steady. The resulting effects on the flame behavior are
tentatively assumed to be minor, but this still needs to be assessed.


While it didn't prevent the acquisition of scientific data, the intended igniter arm,
which establishes the relative positioning of the igniter tip and burner, was not found
for the round-2 hardware set-up. Therefore, an alternate arm, which positioned the
igniter further from the burner than intended, was used for the 3 Sept. 2020 testing.
Fortunately, the flames were still reliably ignited and the proper igniter arm was found
and installed prior to the subsequent test day.


However, it was determined that the 3 Sept. 2020 science objectives were not
accomplished because the fuel didn't always transition to the intended test flow rate.
As a result of concerns about the ignition success because of the use of the alternate
igniter arm, the decision was made to repeatedly ignite the flame at the same fuel
flow rate and then subsequently adjust it to the desired test flow rate. The first
attempt was successful, but the transition time was shortened to save fuel, etc. which
unfortunately prevented the flow transition. In other words, the transition time was
too short where that wasn't discovered until review of the data days later. As a result,
the tests were generally conducted at the same fuel flow rate, where that was meant
to be a variable. As a result, the data currently doesn't allow a full assessment of the
effect of the burner size on the flammability. Therefore, a make-up test day in
Increment 64 has been planned to address this shortcoming.


During testing on 23 Dec. 2020, it was discovered that the lowest of the 14-micron
silicon carbide fibers on the Thin Filament Pyrometry (TFP) fiber array had broken.
After some discussion, testing continued that day. Given that the translating array
had five ceramic fibers, the loss of one was not a significant science loss. But it was a
concern for crew safety. Recovery plans were developed and enacted on January 18
to remove the broken fragments from the harp-like array. Unfortunately, the next
fiber was broken during the delicate operations where the fibers are only spaced 5
mm apart. As a result, the last two BRE test days were conducted with only three
rather than five fibers in the TFP array. ACME does have alternate arrays, but also has
months of remaining testing, so the decision was made to continue testing with only
3 fibers.

# C. Completeness/Quality of Data


The 194 flames ignited for BRE significantly exceeds the 73 tests which were specified as
required in the ACME Integrated Science Requirements Document (ISRD). As such, more
than 2.5 times as many flames were ignited than had been planned.


It should be understood that a complete set of image data is not necessarily available for
all tests. Recorded image data is sometimes deleted without downlinking. This is done
because of operational constraints which limit the amount of data that can be managed
per test day. Given the constraint, the decision is sometimes made to sacrifice some
image data (e.g., from the HiBMs camera) to allow additional tests to be conducted. This
is intentionally done to maximize the scientific return of each day of testing within the
project constraints.

Data quality is of course dependent on the experimental hardware. But neglecting that
limitation on data quality, the cameras are sensitive to radiation where pixels gradually
become 'hot' over time. While these bright spots are addressed in image post-processing,
they are a degradation of the image quality.


See the discussion in III.D regarding fouling or degradation of the paint on the BRE
burner's heat flux sensors.


It is possible that the tests are subtly affected by the acceleration environment, but there
is not obvious indication of such effects and it has thus far not been evaluated with
available measurements from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS).
Note that although the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), in which the experiment is
conducted, is equipped with a Passive Rack Isolation System (PaRIS) it was not utilized for
BRE (or any ACME) testing because of the crew time needed to enable and disable the
isolation before and after testing.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


Regardless of the shortcomings discussed above, a great wealth of experimental data has
been secured and BRE's first round is considered to be successful despite the frequent
saturation of the radiometer data discussed in section III.B.2. Meanwhile, the second
round is tentatively considered to be highly successful, where final assessment will
depend on further review and analysis of the data.


D. Status of Data Analysis (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral student
Parham Dehghani; lightly edited by Dennis Stocker)
All measured transient raw data (e.g., heat flux sensors, thermocouples, radiometers,
mass flow meters and chamber pressure sensor) have been converted to engineering
units and plotted using the calibrations provided in ACME's Software Interface Design
Description (ACME-DOC-010 Rev. D).


All of the round 1 and 2 tests have had the heat flux sensor data reduced using their
original calibrations. As presented below, the data is being processed to address the
effect of the combustion product water condensation on the sensor surfaces.


The primary measurements are used, by two techniques, to obtain the net heat flux from
the flame to the burner surface. In the steady state, this net heat flux divided by the mass
flow rate per unit area of the fuel mixture gives the heat of gasification of the emulated
fuel. The key hypothesis is that the heat of combustion, smoke point, and heat of
gasification of the fuel mixture will represent a real solid fuel (or liquid fuel absorbed in
an inert matrix). Thus, achieved steady burning would represent the potential for real
solid fuels to achieve steady burning in microgravity. Other than for a candle flame, this
has not been shown before.


The first technique uses two thermopile heat flux gages embedded in the burner surface.
One gage is at the center the other is offset from the center (r = 9.5 mm). As the sensors
are not cooled, but rise with temperature as the flame grows, water from its combustion
products can condense and then evaporate from the sensor. This occurs, as the dew point
for combustion products is about 60-70oC, and the sensor begins at ambient temperature
and can achieve temperatures over 100oC. Thus, condensation can occur at temperatures
below the dew point that lead to added heat to the sensor. Above the dew point, the
condensed water will evaporate and reduce the heat to the sensor. When the sensor is
dry and above 100oC, it will only measure the heat flux from the flame gases as intended.


We have duplicated this condensation effect in 1-g laboratory experiments with the
duplicative NASA BRE burner. Fig. 1 illustrates the condensation and evaporation effect
in the ISS tests. The offset sensor in red shows a clear jump increase when the water fully
evaporates. More analysis is needed to properly correct for this effect. Fortunately, by
the end of the test shown here (and for all of the other data), this water effect is gone.

Figure 1. Typical net heat flux of the heat flux sensors.


The second effect on the heat flux sensors is that the heat may have fouled their paint.
This could then affect their calibration. Figure 2 shows an image of the ISS burner after
round 1 test were concluded. It can be seen that the paint on the sensors is degraded.
This was the original manufacturer's paint, instead of that used for the copper top. The
copper paint appears fine. We worked with the heat flux gage manufacturer to explore
the effect of heat damage on the calibration of the sensors. The results showed that the
calibration was stable and didn't change during the process of heating and cooling.

Figure 3 shows that typically the copper temperature is nearly uniform and smooth in
time. It does not appear that condensation or evaporation is having any effect on its
temperature behavior. So, we believe we are justified in using this measurement to
predict the overall average heat flux from the flame to the burner.


Figure 3. Copper and heat flux sensor temperatures in test 19070D1.


Recently it has come to our attention that the actual thermocouple and wiring types were
as summarized in Table 2, below. We used type K conversion coefficients for south (i.e.,
center copper) and far south (i.e., offset copper) thermocouples and type T for heat flux
transducers respectively from NIST data set provided in this link:
https://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/allcoeff.tab


Table 2. Thermocouple and wiring types for BRE burner.


One sees that only the south (i.e., center copper) thermocouple has consistent type K
wiring throughout. This latter thermocouple recorded an initial temperature of 28 deg.
Celsius from which we can infer that initial ambient temperature must be 28 deg. C
applicable to all thermocouples.


Table 2 shows the center transducer thermocouple was mismatched with a type B
extension wire, and the offset transducer was mismatched with a type K extension wire.

Meanwhile the far south (i.e., offset) copper plate thermocouple was of type K, but was
mismatched with type B extension wiring.


Ambient temperature before ignition is applicable to all thermocouples that can be
obtained by using the igniter side and relay side thermocouples. This thermocouple and
its extension wiring are of type K. The BRE burner thermocouples output before test
starts must match igniter side's temperature.


According to the Intermediate Metal Law the extension wires do not affect the voltages
since they are located at a constant temperature throughout their length. Therefore,
each thermocouple voltage is converted to temperature based on their thermocouple
type (shown in Table 2).


Since the south thermocouple output is the only one that shows higher temperature
compared to other three and the igniter side temperature, it is concluded that this
thermocouple is receiving a constant extra voltage of 0.127 mV. Therefore, this spurious
voltage should be subtracted from the south thermocouple voltage. The resulting
temperatures are shown in Figure 4.

and far south thermocouple.

The calorimeter required a new calibration to account for heat being absorbed through
the bevel edge of copper plate. So, control surfaces are now adjusted (i.e., the edge and

burner back surface area, Aback) and then optimized for new set of calibration constants
which are specific to the burner used in ISS tests (i.e., mcCu, hback, hrod, and e0). The
calorimeter represents the average heat flux to the surface and is being used to obtain
heats of gasification. Figure 5 shows the transient plots of test 19066D5. The test
conditions for the plots used in this report are presented in Table 3. We found out that
there is significant heat absorption by the bevel edge of the burner that induces error in
the calorimeter heat flux. A theoretical analysis was employed to estimate the radiative,
convective and re-radiation heat flux to and from the top surface and the bevel edge of
the burner which helped in estimating the error induced in the calorimeter data.

Our analysis of the radiometer sensor data has indicated its consistent ability to measure
the flame overall radiation heat loss fraction. The method to determine the radiative heat
flux component to the burner is more complex, and it is based on the geometrical details
of the radiometers and burner surface relative distance and orientation. Also, the burner
surface will re-radiate heat that impinges the radiometer and it needs to be corrected.
All of the available radiation data are processed for the first round of testing and an
empirical radiation correlation with flame height was found.


The video images of all the flames have been compiled and are being quantified in terms
of flame shapes. Also, a summary booklet of all of the key findings along with heat flux
and surface temperature data for each test was compiled.


Alexander Snegirev, our Russian partner, has attempted a numerical simulation of at least
one of the ISS BRE tests. That work is still in progress. It should be remarked his student
won the Student Prize for Best Presentation at the 9th International Seminar on Fire and
Explosion Hazards held in St. Petersburg, Russia in April 2019 for simulating our 5-s BRE
drop tests.


E. Preliminary Research Findings (submitted by BRE PI Jim Quintiere and doctoral
student Parham Dehghani; lightly edited by Dennis Stocker)
The burner has shown that quasi-steady burning is possible for real solids with a flat
surface of 25 mm diameter. Up to now most flammability studies in microgravity have
focused on flame spread with a wind for concurrent spread and at least a self-induced
wind for opposed flow spread. We already knew that this would be possible from normal-
gravity research. The burning of liquids, as in a wick of a candle flame and small droplets,
has been shown to produce steady flames. However, many droplet flames were found to
extinguish owing to radiative cooling of the flame. We see this as well in the extended
ISS microgravity tests. However, this extinction was predominately seen for nominal
ambient conditions of 21% oxygen and 14.7 psia. At conditions of 27% oxygen, 10.2 psia
and 34% oxygen, 8.2 psia, the flames generally persisted for 3 minutes or more. These are
all atmospheric conditions that NASA is considering for future spacecraft


Figure 6 shows a typical test of ignition and flame growth. Although extinction occurred
at 45 s with the flame still growing, the heat flux was nearly steady by 30 s. Therefore, a
heat of gasification (L) could be estimated. This was done by using the arithmetic average
of the center and offset heat flux sensor as the net average heat flux.

Figures 7 through 10 illustrate results for nominal atmospheric conditions of 26.5%

two figures each. Both use 50% mixtures of nitrogen and ethylene giving a fuel mixture
heat of combustion of 24 kJ/g. Both of these tests reached quasi-steady conditions and
were terminated by shutting off the fuel. The plots of transient heat flux shown by Figures
8 and 10, show the condensation effect removed after 80 s and 40 s respectively and
arithmetic average of the two heat flux gauge measurements at the end of each test is
recorded as steady surface heat flux which are used to obtain heats of gasification.

In Figures 9 and 10 the flame reaches a quasi-steady state in about 80 seconds as seen by
the flame shape and the heat flux data. This emulation corresponds to a material with a
heat of combustion of about 24 kJ/g and a heat of gasification of about 3 kJ/g. As such it
could represent PMMA as a material solid. This is a profound result indicating a common
plastic could steadily burn under these NASA proposed atmospheric conditions.

Figure 9 shows steady results for a NASA proposed nominal atmosphere of 34% oxygen

Radiative loss fraction from the flames are obtained using the radiometer's
measurements. Unfortunately, the data set is limited as BRE sensors were saturated in
many tests. The +60 mm and the offset radiometers were used to obtain the radiative
loss fraction as these two sensors provided data in multiple cases while the other two
radiometers were saturated. The transient radiative loss fraction for 19066D5 and
19070L1 are shown in Figure 11 for both radiometers, which show good agreement with
each other. Table 3 provides information about the test conditions. As BRE radiometers
were saturated for many tests of round 1, the BRE radiometer array was replaced with

the standard ACME array to reduce the likelihood of sensor saturation. The offset
radiometer data has been analyzed and the results are presented in Fig. 20.

Flame heights at the end of the tests are measured from the image data. The radiative
loss fraction is correlated with flame height and fuel mixture mass flux. The results from
first round tests are shown in Figure 12.

end-point results.


A simple analysis, based on the geometrical view factor of the surface with respect to the
flame sheet, allowed us to estimate the fraction of the total available heat that impinges
surface as seen in Figure 13. Also, the analytical model (the ellipsoidal model) based on
classical diffusion theory was used to estimate the convective heat flux to the surface

which is shown in Figure 14. Adding up the convective and radiative heat transport plus
re-radiation from the surface results in a total average heat flux that when divided by fuel
mixture mass flux yields the theoretical heat of gasification.

The experimental flammability maps are shown in Figures 15 and 16. Both plots indicate
a decreasing, inverse asymptotic-like curve that approaches zero, for heat of gasification
with mass flux. It is surprising that the data cluster about a nearly singular trend.
However, both plots show that the heat of gasification is up to 20 % higher for the lower
heat of combustion 23.6 kJ/g. Our tests in the University of Maryland lab have shown,
with the BRE in 1-g that similar results for propane-nitrogen mixtures have the opposite
behavior with heats of gasification decreasing with heat of combustion for the same mass
flux. But again, the data mostly cluster about one trend line except for very low heats of
combustion. However, the corresponding 1-g heat of combustion data shift far to the
right and down from the microgravity data of Figures 15 and 16. For example, the 1-g
data would indicate ( 𝑚̇",𝐿) points of about 30 g/m2s, 2 kJ/g and 10, 0.5. Moreover, our
previous work in a 5- s drop facility suggested similar data trends but with an apparent
vertical asymptote at about 3 g/m2s, rather than 1 as shown here. Obviously, the current
data at durations of minutes are more accurate than those limited to 5 s. However, it has
been shown that the ISS heat flux data even at self-extinction are theoretically nearly
steady. Figures 15 and 16 include the heats of gasification derived from the self-
extinguished endpoint data as well. Remarkably, the self-extinguished not-so-steady data
follow the same trend as the steady data.


Let us interpret Figures 15 and 16 in terms of the flammability of real materials in
microgravity. Typical melting plastics have heats of gasification ranging from about 2 to
3 kJ/g, with effective heats of gasification for charring plastics above 4 kJ/g. Some
selected literature values for materials with heats of combustion in the BRE range are
listed in Table 4. The accuracy of the calorimeter heat flux is found to be less than the
two sensors, thus, we relied on the arithmetic average of the two heat flux sensors data
for obtaining the flammability map. However, same results are shown considering the
calorimeter data. Figure 15 would suggest that polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP)
would burn in microgravity at about 3 g/m2s. Nylon and PMMA would burn at about 2.5
g/m2s, and the phenolic glass fiber composite would burn at about 1 g/m2s.

safety consideration, based on the findings of this study, is that solid materials with heats
of combustion in the range 23.6 to 47.2 kJ/g and heats of gasification from about 1 to 10
kJ/g can burn in microgravity. The NASA alternative flammability Test 2 [1] using the Cone
Calorimeter can measure these material properties. As this study develops a more
complete understanding, NASA may wish to put more emphasis into Test 2.


Moreover, the flammability map based on our theoretical analysis is shown in Figure 17.
It shows similar asymptotic trend and clearly indicates lower pressure and higher oxygen
concentration as favorable conditions for long duration burning.

# Appendix G. Astronauts and Cosmonauts who Conducted ISS Operations for BRE


This list was prepared by Dennis Stocker from his log of ACME operations.


Ten cosmonauts and astronauts participated in ISS operations directly supporting the BRE investigation,
where they are listed with the dates of their activity (at least as planned). They are listed by the number
of days in which they conducted supporting on-orbit activities and alphabetically. The crew activity on
each of those dates is very briefly summarized in the Appendix F. Additional information about the crew
activity can be found in some of the subsequent appendices.


The CIR and ACME hardware was initially set up for BRE testing by Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques,
while U.S. astronaut Chris Cassidy reconfigured the hardware for BRE's second round of testing after
intervening testing for other experiments. Meanwhile, the gas bottles were most often replaced by
Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov.

Week 16: January 11-17
David: On GMT 014, thank you for replacing the imaging modules in the CIR LLL-UV Imaging Package. Then
on GMT 018, great job configuring the back of the CIR Optics Bench to support future ACME experiments.
We appreciate all your hard work and diligence during the many intricate tasks!


# Week 18: January 25-31


David: On GMT 031 & 032, great job configuring the ACME Chamber Insert to support the next ACME
experiment, BRE (Burning Rate Emulator). We appreciate your attention to detail during the many
complicated tasks! We especially appreciate you taking all the closeout photos of the newly installed
hardware. We will check out and calibrate the newly installed hardware next week and perform the first
test points late next week.


# Week 19: February 1-7


Oleg & Anne: Great job replacing the CIR Manifold & GC Bottles this week! We these new bottles installed,
we look forward to starting the next ACME experiment, BRE (Burning Rate Emulator).


# Week 20: February 8-14


On GMT 039, we performed our first ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points. Unlike the other
ACME experiments, BRE is focused on improving spacecraft fire safety rather than practical terrestrial
combustion. More specifically, BRE uses gaseous fuels to determine the flammability of liquids and solids
in microgravity by selecting test conditions to match key parameters. We performed nine successful tests
burning ethylene on the 25-mm diameter burner, where the burner's embedded sensors measure the
heat flux that would normally vaporize a liquid or solid fuel. The tests were conducted under a range of
oxygen concentrations and pressures, including some atmospheres that could be used for future crew
vehicles or habitats.


Figure 1. Sequential Monochrome Images of the First BRE Flame Stabilized on the Cylindrical Burner


Figure 1 shows a sequence of three images from BRE's first on-orbit test. The first image shows that the
flame grew to become nominally hemispherical (over the burner outlet, which can also be seen). The
second image shows a hole in the top of the flame due to radiative heat loss. However, the third image


141




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

shows that the flame recovered, where the hole closed. In this latter phase of the test, measurements of
chemiluminescence (from OH*) clearly reveal that the flame was oscillating at approximately 1 Hz. These
oscillations (the opening and closing of the flame's top) were seen to grow in magnitude and are
associated with the flame's approach to extinction. In the first test, this lasted for an extended time, but
in other tests at lower oxygen concentrations the oscillations sometimes lasted 10 seconds or less before
the flame quenched. BRE seeks to understand the flame extinction and the conditions under which the
flames become unsteady and finally extinguish.


# Week 21: February 15-21


Testing for the Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment resumed on GMT 051 following a revision of the
ignition procedure. Eight successful tests were conducted burning pure ethylene, which is naturally a
sooty fuel because of its double bond, but the soot produced during ignition quickly vanished leaving a
pale blue flame, where the flame temperatures were insufficient to generate soot. These flames grow to
be nominally hemispherical, then become quasi-steady although weakening, and finally become unsteady
and extinguish when radiative heat losses become too great. The experiment's goal is to improve our
understanding of material flammability in microgravity and thereby guide the selection of materials use
in spacecraft.


CAPTION TO VIDEO, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LOG
The video from test 19039G1 is typical of the BRE tests conducted thus far, where the flame grows
to become nominally hemispherical, during which time the soot produced at ignition vanishes.
The flame then becomes quasi-steady, e.g., in terms of the flame shape and size, although it can
be seen that the flame weakens with time - becoming dimmer and more diffuse. Oxygen
transport to the flame is inhibited because it is blanketed by an ever-thickening cloud of carbon
dioxide and water vapor. Eventually, radiative heat loss leads the top of the flame (on the video's
left) to locally extinguish, leaving a hole in the flame. But the fuel and oxygen, which are normally
separated by the flame, mix and the flame quickly reestablishes, filling the hole. A pattern of
oscillation begins, which also features periodic lifting of the flame base from the cylindrical burner
(on the right of the video). The oscillations grow in strength, where the flame becomes
momentarily just a ring. At the end, before complete extinction, the flame also partially detaches
from the burner, leaving a crack in the flame's side extending from the base to its top.


The durations of at least the quasi-steady and unsteady periods are strongly dependent on the
atmosphere in the chamber, where both the oxygen concentration and pressure have been
varied. As one might expect, longer durations are observed at higher oxygen concentrations.


Note that the brighter circle that can be seen in upper middle of the video is due to reflection from
an optical sensor, which is not seen in the other three camera views.


# Week 22: February 22-28


On GMT 056, we performed ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points with a 50% ethylene/50%
nitrogen mixture. The flames with 50% ethylene may be steadier than the 100% ethylene flames, which
require more oxygen at the same total flow rate. The 50% ethylene flames still exhibited flame growth, a
quasi-steady period, and oscillations leading to extinction. The flames also quickly became soot free (i.e.,
all blue flame) after ignition.


142




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


Ignition, extinction, and the three main phases of the BRE flame's life can be seen in this example plot of
the OH* chemiluminescence measured by one of the three PhotoMultipiler Tube (PMT) modules on the
ACME Chamber Insert. OH* is an excited molecule that loses energy by emitting a photon of light at a
specific wavelength (in the ultraviolet). In combustion of most fuels, there is oxygen, hydrogen, and lots
of energy making OH* measurements a good indicator of the flame.


This data shows that the flame is weakening during the quasi-steady period when the flame size and shape
is nominally constant. The OH* measurement also clearly shows the oscillations that precede extinction
and their growing strength. The flame's oscillations (e.g., with the opening and closing of the top) are at
a nominally constant frequency that is a little less than 1 Hz. The huge OH* oscillations are the flame's
death throes when it splits open from bottom to top and partially detaches from the burner.


# Week 23: March 1-7


On GMT 064, Oleg Kononenko replaced the CIR Manifold #2 Bottle that was consumed during test points
on GMT 063. For these ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points, we used higher fuel flow rates with
the same fuel (50% ethylene/50% nitrogen) as the test points on GMT 056. We performed a total of six
tests, where the first-in an atmosphere of 40% oxygen-was notable in that the flame didn't extinguish
during the five-minute test even though it was oscillating in the last three minutes. As expected, the flames
in subsequent tests with higher flow rates grew to be significantly larger in size, and with their higher
oxygen consumption, they extinguished in significantly shorter times. We observed dramatic oscillations
with the large flames. Furthermore, these large oscillating flames became asymmetric; whereas, smaller
BRE flames have been largely axisymmetric even when oscillating.


143




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


CAPTION TO VIDEO, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LOG
The test shown in this video is the first ACME test-of all the experiments thus far-to have such
a high fuel flow rate. Initially, the flame behavior is similar to previous BRE tests. The flame is very
sooty at ignition, due to ethylene's double bond, where you can see the glowing soot particles
pass through the flame. But the soot quickly fades away leaving a dim blue flame, where blue is
the natural color of hydrocarbon flames. The flame expands to reach enough oxygen to consume
the fuel. Meanwhile, the flame is blanketed by a thickening cloud of carbon dioxide and water
vapor inhibiting the oxygen's diffusion to the flame. With the poor oxygen transport, the flame
weakens, and radiative heat loss leaves a hole in the flame. But oxygen then mixes with the fuel,
causing the flame to quickly reestablish and the hole closes.


With this flame's large size, the edge of the flame opening can be seen to curve upward and
outward-somewhat like a vase-where that is the fuel-lean rim of the flame edge. The opening
and closing grows in strength as in previous tests, but the flame size is apparently so large that
asymmetries begin. The flame eventually becomes mostly quenched with just a ring at the base
and a highly dynamic spiral extending upward. As in previous tests, the flame partially detaches
from the burner (right side of video), but in this case, the flame surprisingly persists for roughly
20 seconds despite the large-scale detachment. While careful analysis will be challenging, this
flame is visually dramatic with its swirling pulsations and powerful death throes.


# Week 24/01: March 8-14


On GMT 072, Oleg Kononenko replaced the CIR Manifold #4 Bottle to support upcoming ACME BRE test
points with pure ethylene fuel, and he installed the CIR Manifold #1 Bottle to support the upcoming CIR
FOMA Calibration.


On GMT 066 & 070, we performed the remaining ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points using
diluted ethylene fuel (50% ethylene/50% nitrogen). These tests were conducted with low fuel flow rates
under atmospheric conditions that could be used for future crew exploration vehicles (or habitats), i.e.,
with elevated oxygen concentrations (between 26% and 36%) and reduced pressures. Compared to prior
tests, these flames were steady and didn't extinguish during the allotted test durations.


Even though these flames appeared steady, measurements of OH* and CH* chemiluminescence revealed
that they were slowly weakening as each test progressed. Chemiluminescence occurs when excited
molecules at a high energy state drop to a lower energy state by emitting a photon of a certain
wavelength. CH* chemiluminescence is why hydrocarbon flames are blue; meanwhile the OH*
chemiluminescence is in the ultraviolet.


Although the flames were weakening, the thermal radiation from each flame slowly increased because of
the lack of buoyancy, which, in gravity, removes the hot combustion gases from the vicinity of a flame.
Instead, these flames became blanketed by a thickening cloud of hot and radiating combustion products,
namely carbon dioxide and water vapor. This accumulation of products inhibited the transport of oxygen
to the flame. Yet, with the low flow of diluted fuel, the oxygen diffusion was enough to maintain these
flames during each test's duration. If the test durations weren't limited, these flames would have
eventually gone out, but it could have taken many minutes for that to happen.

Figure 1 shows a flame near the end of a test conducted with 50% ethylene/50% nitrogen in an
atmosphere of approximately 27.5% oxygen at 0.7 bar. The dim blue flame did not appear to visibly
change following ignition. (The dark spots at the base are a result of image processing.)


# Increment 59-60


# Week 2: March 15-21


On GMT 077 and 078 in support of the CIR FOMA Calibration, Oleg Kononenko closed and opened valves
in the CIR's Fuel/Oxidizer Management Assembly (FOMA) and switched the settings on the CIR Valve
Timers. This calibration needs to be completed yearly to ensure that all the pressure transducers in the
CIR are accurate.


# Week 3: March 22-28


On GMT 085, Oleg Kononenko replaced the CIR Manifold #2 Bottle, so we could continue performing
ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points. He also closed the valve on the CIR Manifold #1 Bottle
since this bottle will not be used until a future ACME experiment.


Week 4: March 29 - April 4
On GMT 087, ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points were performed using pure ethylene fuel in
atmospheric conditions that might be used for future crew exploration vehicles or habitats. This
flammability testing has focused on flame conditions at low fuel flow rates, where ignition wasn't always
achieved. Nonetheless, eight successful tests were conducted this day. During the day's final test point,
the igniter tip burned out. On GMT 093, Nick Hague replaced the burnt-out igniter tip.


145




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

This plot illustrates the challenge faced in igniting some BRE tests. The plot is of OH* chemiluminescence,
which is measured by a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) during the ignition period. Chemiluminescence occurs
when a molecule drops from a higher to a lower energy level by emitting a photon of a specific
wavelength. In this case, the excited OH* emits light in ultraviolet (at 310 nm). While this light is not
visible, it is a good indicator of the flame's strength or intensity. This plot shows how the flame repeatedly
flashed across the burner. The flame didn't stabilize until after the igniter was retracted. Unfortunately,
by that time the igniter tip had already burned out.


# Week 5: April 5-11


On GMT 094, the final test points were performed for the first round of testing for ACME BRE (Burning
Rate Emulator). These were the first BRE test points to use very fine ceramic fibers in the flame to acquire
temperature measurements from the color of the glowing fibers. During the past two months, over 60
flames were ignited in this first round of testing to improve our understanding of microgravity
flammability.


This week, Christina Koch configured the ACME Chamber Insert to support the next ACME experiment,
Flame Design. Also to support Flame Design, Oleg Kononenko replaced the bottles on CIR Manifold #2,
CIR Manifold #4, and the CIR GC Helium Manifold. Flame Design is focused on understanding the soot
processes of flames. Test points will start in a few weeks.

Figure 1. Sample preliminary images from a BRE test, where both were processed from the same raw
image file. Image (a) reveals the relative positions of the glowing ceramic fibers, while (b) is adjusted for
determination of the temperature along the fibers.


Figure 1 displays sample images, in which Thin Filament Pyrometry (TFP) was used to allow optical
determination of the temperature along the ceramic fibers where they are hot enough to visibly glow.
The harp-like array of 14-micron SiC fibers was translated throughout the flame allowing measurement of
the entire temperature field. The temperature is determined by comparison of the red, blue, and green
color planes of the images, which were taken with a digital camera characterized for quantitative
measurements. The color of the fiber's glow is indicative of the temperature, where yellow is hotter than
orange, which in turn is hotter than red. (The blue in the flame results from the flame chemistry rather
than the fibers' broadband thermal radiation.)


# BRE round 2, featuring tests with ethylene & methane and the 25-mm & 50-mm burners


2020
Week 20: August 21-27
On GMT 239, Chris Cassidy replaced the bottles and lubricated the QDs on the CIR GC Helium Manifold,
the CIR GC Check Gas Manifold, the CIR Manifold #2 and the CIR Manifold #4. On GMT 240, Chris Cassidy
configured the ACME Chamber Insert and the CIR Combustion Chamber. These tasks prepared the CIR and
ACME for supporting the next ACME experiment, BRE Part 2 (Burning Rate Emulator). BRE studies material
flammability with the goal of improving spacecraft fire safety.

# Week 22: September 4-10


On GMT 247, we began the second round of testing for ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) with 13 flames
ignited using ethylene fuel. While the first round of testing only used the 25-mm diameter burner, this
round of testing began with the 50-mm diameter burner to better understand the effect of burner size on
flame behavior. Even though these flames burned for a long time, they were unsteady and extremely
dynamic. Since BRE's research focus is on quasi-steady flame behavior, the remaining tests will use the


25-mm burner.


In many of these 50-mm burner tests, heat loss caused the top of the flame to locally quench-creating a
hole that allowed for increased mixing of the fuel and oxygen. The flame was able to reestablish, closing
the hole in its top. These oscillations occurred repeatedly and grew in strength such that the flame became
a ring instead of a dome. Later in the burn, the flame often partially detached from the burner, creating a
hole in the side of the flame that would also open and close repeatedly. In some cases, this behavior
transitioned to a more constant hole, where the partial flame would swirl around the burner's rim as if it
were "chasing its tail."


CAPTION TO VIDEO, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LOG
This clip from a test point video shows the flame dynamics observed in the latter portion of the
test. This test is burning 100% ethylene fuel in a combustion chamber environment of about 32%
oxygen/68% nitrogen. The flame, which in microgravity would normally be dome-shaped, has
largely quenched where only a portion is burning. In this phase of the burn, the flame appears to
have mostly detached from the burner. The flame swirls around the burner's rim, where the
leading edge is bright because of the fuel/oxidizer mixing that occurs where the flame has
quenched. While the nature of the oscillations changed over time, they made up about 70% of
the flame's life. In fact, this flame was still oscillating when the fuel flow was shut off (at a preset
time), and the flame went out.


# Week 23: September 11 - 17


In support of ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points, Chris Cassidy replaced the burner, igniter
arm and tip, and two mass flow controllers on the ACME Chamber Insert on GMT 258. This burner allows
for steadier flames, and the mass flow controllers allow for slower nitrogen and fuel flow rates.


# Week 24: September 18 - 24


On GMT 261, 13 ethylene flames were ignited for ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) with its primary
burner, which has a 25-mm diameter outlet. Today's flames were steadier than those with the 50-mm
burner used on the previous test day. In fact, one of today's tests appears to be the most stable BRE flame
thus far, including the 62 BRE flames ignited in early 2019. The stability of flames in a no-breeze
environment has important fire safety implications. The current approach to spacecraft fire is to stop
ventilation so that the flames will quench, but the BRE results indicate that there are conditions under
which flames will continue to burn in still air.


On GMT 266, Anatoly Ivanishin replaced the bottles at CIR Manifold #2 and CIR Manifold #4. An issue with
the CIR Manifold #4 bottle valve delayed testing this week. From crew photos and video, we determined
that the valve is already fully open, which we confirmed with powered ops on GMT 267. The CIR Bottle
Valve Cover was cross-threaded when last installed, which caused it to bind on the valve. When rotating
the valve cover to remove it, the valve also rotated. We will be able to resume test points next week!

ACME BRE Test Point Image


1 Feb. 2022


This image of a dome-shaped flame is from late in a test in which the blue flame remained quasi-steady


(i.e., changes are occurring at such a slow rate that the flame can be considered constant). The burner is


illuminated from the left in red. The test was conducted in an atmosphere of about 30% oxygen (with a
balance of nitrogen and gases resulting from preceding tests) with a reduced pressure of roughly 0.6 atm.
Future crew exploration may feature vehicles and habitats at elevated oxygen concentrations and reduced
pressures to facilitate ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA). BRE includes testing under such conditions because
of the increased fire hazard with elevated oxygen concentrations.


# Week 25: September 25 - October 1


In support of ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points, Anatoly Ivanishin replaced the CIR GC Argon
Bottle and opened the bottle valve at CIR Manifold #2 on GMT 272. He also took some very nice, detailed
photos of the damaged CIR Bottle Valve Cover.


# Week 26: October 2 - 8


On GMT 279, a record 21 flames were successfully ignited for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator)
experiment using methane as the fuel, which was a first for this investigation. Methane is the primary
component of natural gas and is a good contrast to ethylene, the fuel used in BRE's preceding test days.
Ethylene (C2H4) is naturally sooty in normal-gravity flames because of its C=C double bond; whereas,
methane (CH4) has no carbon bonds. With a goal of improved spacecraft fire safety, BRE simulates the
combustion of solid and liquid materials by matching key parameters in tests conducted with gaseous
fuels. Testing with different gaseous fuels provides an understanding of flammability for a broader range
of materials.

ACME BRE Test Point Image


1 Feb. 2022


This preliminary false-colored image of a dome-shaped flame is from late in a test in which the blue flame
remained quasi-steady through most of the test duration. Quasi-steady describes when changes are
occurring at such a slow rate that the flame can be considered constant. This photo was taken shortly
before the flame oscillated for a few seconds and then self-extinguished. While the flame's top often
locally quenches due to radiative heat loss, in this example the flame's circular rim (at its base) has pulled
away from the burner due to conductive heat loss. The curvature of the flame's rim away from, rather
than toward, the burner's edge (which can be faintly seen on the left) is evidence of the flame-burner
separation and the approach of the subsequent flame instability.

# Week 8: December 4 - 10


On GMT 339, 18 flames were ignited for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) experiment. In this
experiment, the University of Maryland's Dept. of Fire Protection Engineering studies microgravity
flammability in quiescent (i.e., no-breeze) atmospheres. These tests were conducted using methane,
which is the primary component of natural gas, as the fuel. By innovatively matching key properties, BRE
uses gaseous fuels to study the flammability of solid and liquid materials. These tests were conducted in
oxygen concentrations of up to 40% with a goal of investigating fire risks in atmospheres being considered
for future spacecraft and habitats.


On GMT 345, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov replaced the gas bottles at CIR Manifold #2 and CIR Manifold #4 to
support upcoming ACME BRE test points using diluted ethylene fuel (50% ethylene/50% nitrogen).

ACME BRE Test Point Image


1 Feb. 2022


This preliminary false-colored image of a dome-shaped flame shows an array of 14-micron ceramic fibers
making temperature measurements. The four visible fibers pass through or near the flame and glow
because of the high temperature. This flame, which is non-premixed, is like a bubble in that the methane
fuel is inside the bubble and the oxygen is outside the bubble. The flame shell, like the film of a bubble, is
a thin sheet where the methane and oxygen come together and react, producing carbon dioxide, water
vapor, light, and heat. The fibers are only visible where they are hot, near the flame shell, which is why
the centers of the three lower fibers are not visible.


The temperature profile along each fiber is optically determined from its varying hue through a technique
known as Thin Filament Pyrometry (TFP). In this image, the blue has been enhanced so that the soot-free
flame is clearly visible along with the much brighter fibers, which naturally transition from red to orange
to yellow as the temperature increases.


# Week 9: December 11 - 17


On GMT 346, 12 flames were ignited for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) experiment. To
investigate the microgravity flammability of solid materials, these tests burned nitrogen-diluted ethylene
fuel (50% ethylene/50% nitrogen). Generally, the flames continued to burn through their test duration,
where some exhibited partial detachment from the burner's rim or partial quenching-creating a hole in
the flame top. Other flames were quasi-steady, which means changes were occurring at such a slow rate
that the flame could be considered constant. The results from these tests may guide material selection
for future spacecraft.


On GMT 350, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov replaced the gas bottles at CIR Manifold #2 and CIR Manifold #4 to
support upcoming ACME BRE test points using pure ethylene fuel.

This clip from a test point video shows the flame dynamics observed in the latter portion of the
test. Early in the test, the array of five ceramic fibers was translated into the flame to determine

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

temperature measurements from the color of the glowing fibers. In the second half of the test,
the flame begins to locally quench due to radiative heat loss. The hole allows the fuel and oxygen,
which are normally separated by the flame sheet, to mix. This mixing enhances flammability and
causes the flame to reestablish and the hole to close. This oscillatory behavior occurs repeatedly
at roughly 1 Hz while the opening in the flame becomes successively greater. This flame would
have self-extinguished but was put out when the fuel was shut off at a preset time.


# Week 10: December 18 - 24


On GMT 352, ten nitrogen-diluted ethylene flames were ignited for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator)
experiment. Ethylene's (C2H4) C=C double bond can create sooty flames. These tests were conducted in
oxygen concentrations ranging between 32% to 40%. BRE's goal is to improve our understanding of
material flammability in microgravity and thereby guide the selection of materials used in spacecraft.


On GMT 356, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov replaced the gas bottle at CIR Manifold #2 to continue supporting
ACME BRE test points.


CAPTION TO VIDEO, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LOG
Upon ignition, the ethylene flame in this video clip exhibits a lot of soot, which is bright whitish-
yellow in appearance. On Earth, soot is normally consumed as it passes through the flame sheet,
but in this test point the soot particles are large enough to escape the flame. In microgravity, soot
growth can be enhanced because it stays within the flame longer due to the absence of buoyancy.
Despite this enhanced residence time, the soot fades away quickly as the burn continues. High
temperatures are required to create the soot and microgravity conditions can lead to lower flame
temperatures. There is no buoyancy to bring in fresh oxygen and the combustion products blanket
these low-momentum flames. The carbon dioxide, water vapor, and soot contribute to radiative
heat loss. This video clip ends as the flame becomes mostly blue and soot-free.


# Week 11: December 25 - 31


On GMT 358, 17 ethylene flames were ignited for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) experiment.
These tests were conducted in oxygen concentrations ranging from 24% to 40%, and the ethylene fuel
was generally diluted with nitrogen. At the higher oxygen concentrations, the flames were generally quasi-
steady and continued to burn until the fuel was shut off. In contrast, at the lower oxygen concentrations,
the flames all self-extinguished. On GMT 364, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov replaced the gas bottle at CIR
Manifold #2 to support continuation of ACME BRE test points.

# ACME BRE Graph


1 Feb. 2022


This graph shows as a function of time, the fuel flow (red) and three optical flame measurements from a
test in which pure ethylene was burned. The optical flame measurements were made with
Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) modules of OH* chemiluminescence (purple), CH* chemiluminescence (light
blue), and broadband emissions in the visible and near UV spectrum (dark blue). OH* and CH* are
transient molecules which, in the process of chemiluminescence, emit a photon at specific wavelengths
when they drop to a lower energy level. The CH* chemiluminescence is the principal source of the blue
seen in hydrocarbon flames, while OH* is in the ultraviolet and is used in ACME to indicate ignition and
extinction.


The initially sooty flame was ignited at 32 seconds, after which the hot-wire igniter was retracted. At about
60 seconds, after the ceramic fiber array was inserted, the flame became quasi-steady. But the PMT
signals weakened with time, where the low-momentum flame became increasingly blanketed by carbon
dioxide and water vapor in the absence of buoyancy.


At about 95 seconds, the increasing radiative loss caused the flame's top to quench, creating a hole in the
flame. This hole allowed the fuel and oxygen, which are normally separated by the flame, to directly mix.
This mixing enhanced flammability, and the flame quickly reestablished and closed the hole, but then
again, it locally quenched. This oscillatory behavior happened repeatedly at roughly 1 Hz with the flame
opening growing with time until the flame became just a ring. We saw this phenomenon in the first round
of BRE testing performed on ISS in 2019. A paper about computational modeling of it is now in press.


At about 135 seconds, the flame began to partially detach from the rim of the burner and then reattach
until it completely extinguished at 148 seconds.

Week 14: January 15 - 21
In support of ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points, Victor Glover removed the broken fiber and
replaced the igniter tip on the ACME Chamber Insert on GMT 018. On GMT 020, 15 ethylene flames were
ignited for the ACME BRE experiment. The array of ceramic fibers (now with three instead of five
functional fibers) was successfully used to determine the temperature distributions where the fibers were
hot enough to visibly glow. Tests were conducted in atmospheres being considered for future spacecraft
and habitats, where that included elevated oxygen concentrations and reduced pressures which can
facilitate EVA preparation. At normal atmospheric conditions (e.g., ~21% oxygen by volume), the flames
all self-extinguished. In contrast, three of the five tests conducted at 30-35% oxygen and 0.57 bar (i.e., 8.2
psia) featured quasi-steady flames, which continued to burn through the test duration. While the oxygen
concentration dominates the flame behavior, this day's tests will enable a better understanding of the
role of the atmospheric pressure on microgravity flammability. On GMT 021, Kate Rubins replaced the gas
bottles at CIR Manifold #2 and CIR Manifold #4 to support continuation of ACME BRE test points.


# Week 15: January 22 - 28


In support of ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) test points, Kate Rubins replaced the burner in the ACME
Chamber Insert on GMT 025. In contrast to the 25-mm burner that was removed, this burner is 50 mm in
diameter and allows for larger flames. Tests are being conducted with this larger burner to investigate the
dependence of the microgravity flammability on flame size.


Week 16: January 29 - February 4
On GMT 028, the final test points were performed for the ACME BRE (Burning Rate Emulator) experiment
led by researchers from the University of Maryland and Russia's Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic
University. In the study of microgravity flammability, 13 flames were ignited with the 50-mm diameter
burner at oxygen concentrations from 40% to 23% in 1 atm. This larger burner allows for larger flames
compared to the 25-mm burner that was used for previous tests. Generally, these larger flames tended
to self-extinguish due to radiative heat loss, which scales with the flame size. In contrast, the smaller
flames on the 25-mm burner were generally quasi-steady. BRE studies material flammability with the goal
of improving spacecraft fire safety.


On GMT 034, Kate Rubins and Victor Glover configured the ACME Chamber Insert to support the next
ACME experiment, CLD Flame Part 3 (Coflow Laminar Diffusion). The general goal of CLD Flame is to
extend the range of flame conditions that can be accurately predicted, especially under conditions where
the flame is sooty or could become unstable. The results could lead to the improved design of practical
combustion devices on Earth.


CAPTION TO VIDEO, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LOG
This clip from a test point video shows a flame's oscillatory "death throes" leading ultimately to
the flame's extinction (not shown in the clip). Initially, radiative heat loss causes the top of the
flame (on the video's left) to locally quench, creating a hole in the flame. That opening allows the
fuel (from the burner) and oxygen (in the chamber) to directly mix, which increases the
flammability and causes the flame to reestablish. But, due to heat loss, the flame partially
quenches again, and the opening grows with each oscillation cycle. Later, the flame also begins to
detach from the burner's rim, leaving an opening at the flame's base (on the video's right). Here
too the flame reestablishes but then opens again-the opening growing until it extends from the


154




ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

burner to the flame's top. At this point in the flame's powerful death throes, it begins swirling
around the burner's rim. This behavior is notably evident in the glowing ceramic fibers, which can
be seen to glow on alternating ends when heated by the swirling flame. To gain a better
understanding of this extinction phenomena, the local temperatures of the flame will be derived
from the glowing fibers.

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)

# Appendix N. Summary of the ISS data collection


The BRE data is all digital and includes both image and non-image data, where this is true for the other
ACME experiments. To be clear, there was no collection of soot or other physical samples that were
subsequently transported to the ground.


The BRE image data includes images from the following cameras:


1. ACME DataCam, used with a clear fused-silica 'filter' and various zoom and focus settings (but those settings were consistent within each individual test)

2. CFI intensified camera, typically used with a CH* filter (and likely always or nearly always for BRE)

3. High-Bitdepth Multispectral (HiBMs) camera, equipped with a red filter corresponding to the opposing CIR illumination package, which was sometimes left off


The raw DataCam images are in a Halcon Iconic Object (hobj) format, while the images from the CFI, and
HiBMs cameras are provided in a Tagged Image File (tif) format. In contrast, the analog video was
recorded on the ground in a Transport Stream (ts) format.


The key non-imaging data from a test is a comma-delimited file that is described in detail in the Software
Interface Design Description (ACME-DOC-010 Rev. D).


The raw data is currently archived at NASA and work is underway to make it available publicly through
NASA's Physical Science Informatics System (PSI).

ACME/BRE Final Report (2022)


1 Feb. 2022


Meanwhile, NASA promoted awareness of ISS combustion research with the video 'The Power of
Studying Combustion on the ISS' which was posted on March 13, 2018.


Awareness of ISS combustion research, including the ACME project, was promoted on Oct. 15, 2018
by The Combustion Institute in their online news article, "International Space Station (ISS) Combustion
Experiments."


Stocker is involved in a broad range of NASA educational outreach to students and teachers, Scouts
of both genders, and the general public. His primary outreach focus is the fundamentals of
microgravity (for which resources are available via http://tinyurl.com/SEECmicrogravity) and human
spaceflight. But he periodically addresses other topics, e.g., where he sometimes speaks on 'NASA
and the Science of Superman' - for example at the Superman Celebration in Metropolis, IL. In this
regard, his NASA outreach is carried out locally, regionally, nationally, and online. For example, he
regularly presents on microgravity at Space Center Houston's Space Exploration Educators Conference
(SEEC). He has exhibited the last five National Scout Jamborees, four national Boy Scout conferences,
the last three national Girl Scout conventions, and the 2019 World Scout Jamboree (which was held
in the U.S.). Stocker has been a key lead for the agency in NASA's participation in these Scouting
events, where as an example the latter outreach is visually described at
www.nasa.gov/feature/stem/world-scout-jamboree.html.
